## Team Traits
When a team is created, it is assigned a random trait which influences its behavior.

*   **Aggressive:** Prefers to attack enemy lines and use high-risk actions.
*   **Expansive:** Focuses on creating new points and lines to cover more ground.
*   **Defensive:** Favors fortifying territory and protecting its existing lines.
*   **Balanced:** Has no strong preference for any particular type of action.

## Actions
On its turn, a team will perform one of the following actions, with the choice being influenced by its trait.

*   **[EXPAND] Add Line:** Connect two of its own points with a new line.
*   **[EXPAND] Extend Line:** Extend an existing line to the border of the grid, creating a new point.
*   **[EXPAND] Grow Line (Vine):** Grow a new, short line segment from an existing point, creating organic, branching structures.
*   **[FIGHT] Attack Line:** Extend an existing line. If it hits an enemy team's line, the enemy line is destroyed.
*   **[FIGHT] Convert Point:** Sacrifice one of its own lines to convert the nearest enemy point to its team, if it's within range.
*   **[FIGHT] Nova Burst:** Sacrifice one of its own points to destroy all nearby enemy lines in a radius.
*   **[DEFEND] Shield Line:** Apply a temporary shield to one of its lines, making it immune to attacks for a few turns.
*   **[DEFEND] Fortify Territory:** If three points and their connecting lines form a triangle, the team can claim that triangle as its territory, shading the area in its color.
*   **[FORTIFY] Create Anchor:** Sacrifice one of its own points to turn another into a gravitational anchor. For a few turns, the anchor will slowly pull nearby enemy points towards it.
*   **[FORTIFY] Mirror Structure:** Selects two of its points to form an axis, then reflects some of its other points across this axis to create new points, forming symmetrical patterns.
