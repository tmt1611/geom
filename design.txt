# Geometric Divination Game - MVP Design

## 1. Game Concept

A web-based game played on a 10x10 grid, with two primary goals:

1.  **Auto-Battle Sandbox**: To create a highly random and visually interesting auto-battle where teams of points expand and compete.
2.  **Divination Tool**: To create a "divine" game where the final geometric patterns on the grid can be interpreted, similar to an astrology chart or horoscope. For example, a user could input points corresponding to their birthday and today's date and interpret the resulting settled state.

## 2. Core Components

-   **Grid**: A 10x10 playing field.
-   **Points**: Belongs to a team, has coordinates on the grid.
-   **Teams**: A collection of points, identified by a name and color.
-   **Lines**: Connects two points of the same team.

## 3. Game Phases

The game proceeds in three distinct phases:

### Phase 1: Initialization
-   The user creates teams.
-   The user adds points to the grid for each team.
-   (Optional) The user can use randomly generated points.

### Phase 2: Action
-   The game progresses in turns.
-   In each turn, each team performs a randomly selected action.
-   The actions are primarily geometric (e.g., expanding, fighting).
-   The user can advance the game turn-by-turn or let it auto-play until a stopping condition is met.
-   Stopping criteria can include a maximum number of turns.
-   A game log reports the actions taken each turn.

### Phase 3: Interpretation
-   Once the action phase is complete, the final state of the grid is analyzed.
-   The application will provide data to help the user interpret the result.
-   **For Auto-Battle**: A scoring system could be implemented.
-   **For Divination**: Geometric analysis will be provided (e.g., number of triangles, total area occupied by a team, number of lines, etc.).

## 4. Example Actions (from rules.txt)

-   **[EXPAND ACTION]**: Add a line segment connecting two random points of the same team.
-   **[EXPAND ACTION]**: Extend a random line segment of a team. If this line hits the border of the grid, create a new point for the team at that coordinate.
-   **[FIGHT ACTION]**: Extend a random line segment of a team. If it intersects with an enemy team's line segment, the enemy's line segment is removed.
-   **[FORTIFY ACTION]**: If three points of a team form a triangle, the area is marked as controlled territory for that team.
