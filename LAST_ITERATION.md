# Iteration Analysis and Changelog

## 1. Analysis Summary
This iteration focuses on improving the strategic depth and code quality. I've introduced a new geometric structure, the **Sentry**, which unlocks a point-destroying attack, creating new offensive and defensive possibilities.

To support this and improve overall robustness, I've also implemented a centralized `_delete_point_and_connections` helper function. This function ensures that whenever a point is removed from the game (either through sacrifice or attack), all its associated connections and structures (lines, shields, territories, bastions, anchors) are correctly and cleanly removed. This refactoring fixes several latent bugs in actions like `nova_burst` and `bastion_pulse` where cascading deletions were not fully handled, making the simulation more stable and predictable.

## 2. Key Changes

### 2.1. New Structure: The Sentry
- **Files**: `game_app/game_logic.py`, `static/js/main.js`, `rules.md`
- **Concept:** A new defensive/offensive structure formed by three collinear points of the same team, with the necessary connecting lines. The middle point becomes the "eye" and the outer two become "posts".
- **New Action `[FIGHT] Sentry Zap`:** An active Sentry can fire a high-energy, short-range beam along its perpendicular axis. This beam is unique as it targets and **destroys an enemy point**, rather than a line. This is a powerful tool for removing high-value enemy assets like bastion cores or anchors.
- **Backend (`game_logic.py`):**
    - Added `sentries` to the game state.
    - Implemented `_update_sentries_for_team` to detect Sentry formations each turn.
    - Implemented the `fight_action_sentry_zap` function with geometric checks for targeting.
    - Integrated the new action into the AI's decision-making process (`_choose_action_for_team`), with a high weight for `Aggressive` teams.
- **Frontend (`static/js/main.js`):**
    - Updated `drawPoints` to render Sentry eyes (circle with a dot) and posts (smaller circles) with a distinct style.
    - Added a new "zap" visual effect for the Sentry attack, including a quick lightning-like ray and an explosion effect on the destroyed point.

### 2.2. Code Refactoring & Bug-fixing
- **File**: `game_app/game_logic.py`
- **New `_delete_point_and_connections` Helper:**
    - Created a single, robust function responsible for deleting a point and handling all cascading consequences. This includes removing connected lines, shields, associated territories, anchors, and updating or dissolving bastions.
- **Refactored Existing Actions:**
    - `sacrifice_action_nova_burst`, `fortify_action_create_anchor`, and `fight_action_bastion_pulse` were all refactored to use the new `_delete_point_and_connections` helper.
    - **This fixed several bugs** where sacrificing or destroying a point (e.g., a bastion prong) did not correctly clean up all associated game elements, leading to potential state inconsistencies. The simulation is now more robust.

### 2.3. Documentation
- **File**: `rules.md`
- The rules were updated to include a detailed explanation of the new Sentry structure and its `Sentry Zap` ability.
