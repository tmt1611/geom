# Iteration Analysis and Changelog

## 1. Analysis Summary
The previous iteration established a robust application with unique IDs for points, a variety of actions, and initial "divination" text. However, all teams behaved identically, leading to similar game arcs. The setup UI was functional but could be clearer, and the visual feedback for actions could be expanded. The core opportunity was to introduce strategic diversity to make the auto-battles more interesting and unpredictable, a key goal from the design document.

This iteration focuses on giving each team a unique "personality" through traits, adding a new defensive action, and improving the UI/UX for a cleaner, more intuitive user flow.

## 2. Implemented Features and Improvements

### Core Gameplay & Backend (`game_logic.py`)
-   **New Feature - Team Traits:**
    -   Introduced four team "traits": `Aggressive`, `Expansive`, `Defensive`, and `Balanced`.
    -   When a team is created, it's randomly assigned a trait.
    -   The backend now uses a weighted-random selection for actions based on the team's trait, causing teams to behave according to their "personality" (e.g., Aggressive teams attack more often). This was implemented in a new `_choose_action_for_team` method.
-   **New Action - "Shield Line":**
    -   Added a new `shield_action_protect_line` defensive action.
    -   A team can apply a temporary shield to one of its lines, making it immune to the `attack_line` action for 3 turns. This adds a new layer of strategy and is favored by `Defensive` teams.
-   **Backend Robustness:**
    -   Lines are now assigned a unique ID upon creation, similar to points. This is essential for the new shield system to reliably track which line is protected.
    -   Point ID generation was made more robust by removing dependency on list indexes, using a simple UUID instead.

### Frontend and UI/UX Improvements
-   **Improved UI - Control Panel Redesign (`index.html`, `style.css`):**
    -   The setup controls have been reorganized into clear groups using `<fieldset>` elements: "Create Teams", "Place Points", and "Game Settings".
    -   This provides a much cleaner visual hierarchy and a more intuitive step-by-step process for the user.
    -   The "Reset Game" button was moved to be globally accessible, outside of the phase-specific panels.
-   **UI Feedback - Team Traits (`main.js`, `style.css`):**
    -   When a team is created in the setup phase, its randomly assigned trait is now immediately displayed next to its name in the team list. This allows the user to see the "personalities" of the teams before the game starts.
-   **Visual Feedback - Shielded Lines (`main.js`):**
    -   Shielded lines are now visually distinct on the canvas. They are rendered with a thick, light-blue "halo" underneath the main line, providing clear and immediate feedback for the new shield action.

### Documentation
-   **Updated Rules (`rules.md`):** The rules documentation was updated to explain the new Team Traits system and describe the new "Shield Line" action.
