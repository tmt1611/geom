# Iteration Analysis and Changelog

## 1. Analysis Summary

The previous iteration of the application established a solid "auto-battle" foundation with expansion and attack actions. However, it was missing a key geometric and visual element mentioned in `rules.md`: the concept of controlling territory. The UI, while functional, lacked debugging tools for developers or curious users. The final interpretation panel was effective but could be more concise by hiding zero-value stats. The goal for this iteration was to deepen the geometric simulation, improve visual feedback, and add developer/debug support.

## 2. Implemented Features and Improvements

This iteration introduces a major new game mechanic, enhances the visualization, and adds quality-of-life features for both users and developers.

### Feature: New "Fortify Territory" Action
-   **New Backend Logic (`game_logic.py`):**
    -   A new `fortify_action_claim_territory` method has been implemented. Teams can now use their turn to find a triangle of their points connected by lines.
    -   A new `territories` list was added to the game state to track these claimed areas.
    -   The action is now part of the random action pool in `run_next_turn`, with corresponding log messages for success or failure.
-   **Visual Representation (`static/js/main.js`):**
    -   A new `drawTerritories` function now renders claimed triangles on the canvas as semi-transparent, filled polygons in the team's color. This provides clear, immediate visual feedback for the "Fortify" action and makes the board state much more visually interesting, fulfilling a core requirement of `design.md`.
-   **Updated Interpretation:** The final analysis now includes a "Territory Area" calculation for each team, adding another dimension to the "divination" aspect of the game.

### Frontend and UI/UX Improvements
-   **Debug Support (`index.html`, `main.js`):**
    -   A "Show Point Indices" checkbox has been added to the Analysis panel.
    -   When enabled, the canvas will render the numerical index above each point. This is a powerful debugging tool for understanding which points are involved in lines, territories, and game log events.
-   **Cleaner Interpretation Table (`main.js`):**
    -   The "Final Analysis" table is now smarter. It dynamically hides rows for statistics that have a value of zero, preventing clutter and focusing the user's attention on the most relevant results.

### Code Quality and Refactoring
-   **Backend (`game_logic.py`):** The interpretation logic was updated to correctly calculate statistics for the new territory feature. The logic for finding triangles, previously only used for counting, is now reused for the Fortify action.
-   **Frontend (`main.js`):** The rendering logic was modularized by adding the `drawTerritories` function. The `drawPoints` function was cleanly updated to include the optional debug information.
