# Iteration Analysis and Changelog

## 1. Analysis Summary
The previous iteration successfully introduced visual aids like convex hulls and live stats, significantly improving the analysis phase. However, the user workflow during the initial setup phase was somewhat rigid. Deleting a misplaced point required using the "Undo" button, which only removed the very last point placed, regardless of team. This could be frustrating if an error was noticed late. Additionally, the set of game actions, while diverse, could be expanded to create more dynamic and surprising game outcomes.

This iteration focuses on improving the user experience during setup and enriching the core gameplay with a new strategic action.

## 2. Implemented Features and Improvements

### Gameplay & Backend (`game_logic.py`)
-   **New Action - Convert Point:** A new `FIGHT` action, `fight_action_convert_point`, has been added. An attacking team can sacrifice one of its own lines to "convert" a nearby enemy point, causing it to switch teams.
-   **Enhanced AI:** The new action is integrated into the team AI (`_choose_action_for_team`). It is favored by 'Aggressive' teams, adding another layer to their personality and providing a new offensive strategy.
-   **Improved Logging:** The game log now correctly reports the outcome of the new "Convert Point" action.

### Frontend UI/UX (`main.js`)
-   **New Feature - Targeted Point Deletion:** During the `SETUP` phase, users can now click directly on any point on the grid to delete it. This replaces the old, rigid "place-only" click behavior and makes correcting mistakes much easier.
-   **Improved UX:** The mouse cursor now changes to a 'pointer' when hovering over a deletable point and a 'crosshair' over empty space during setup, providing clear visual feedback.
-   **Code Refactoring:** The JavaScript code for handling point placement in the setup phase has been significantly refactored for clarity and maintainability, introducing helper functions like `redrawSetupPoints` to reduce duplication.
-   **Visual Feedback:** When a "Convert Point" action occurs, the converted point is now highlighted with a yellow glow for a few seconds to draw the user's attention to the event.

### Documentation (`rules.md`)
-   The official game rules have been updated to include a description of the new "Convert Point" action.
