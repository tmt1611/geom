This iteration focused on refactoring and streamlining the structure system to be more consistent with `design.md` and `rules.md`.

1.  **Unified Rune Storage**: Several structures that `rules.md` defines as "Runes" (Nexus, Prism, Trebuchet) were stored in separate top-level keys in the game state (e.g., `state['nexuses']`). They have now been consolidated into the `state['runes']` dictionary, categorized by their type (e.g., `state['runes'][teamId]['nexus']`).
2.  **Updated Structure Registry**: The `structure_data.py` registry was updated to reflect this new storage model. The definitions for Nexus, Prism, and Trebuchet were changed to point to the `runes` state key.
3.  **Refactored Game Logic**: Code across `game_logic.py`, `fight_actions.py`, and `sacrifice_actions.py` was updated to read from the new, unified `runes` dictionary instead of the old, separate state keys. This simplifies the state structure and makes the code that depends on it more consistent.
4.  **Cleaned Up State Initialization**: The `reset()` method in `game_logic.py` was cleaned up by removing the now-obsolete state keys (`nexuses`, `prisms`, `trebuchets`).

This change makes the internal data model more closely align with the game's conceptual model, improving code clarity and maintainability without altering game mechanics.
