# Iteration Analysis and Changelog

## 1. Analysis Summary
The previous iteration was successful in improving the AI's intelligence and giving the user more control over the simulation playback speed. However, the user experience during the setup phase was a bit rigid, lacking a way to correct mistakes like adding a wrong team. Furthermore, the game's conclusion felt abrupt, and the final results display was dense and difficult to parse quickly.

This iteration focuses on improving the setup-phase flexibility, making the game's conclusion more satisfying, and presenting the final analysis in a much more readable and visually appealing format.

## 2. Implemented Features and Improvements

### Gameplay & Backend (`game_logic.py`)
-   **New Victory Condition - Dominance:** A new way to win has been introduced. If a single team is the sole survivor on the grid for 3 consecutive turns, it is declared the dominant winner, and the simulation ends. This adds a more dynamic goal to the "auto-battle" aspect of the game.
-   **Refactored Game State Machine:** The internal state management was improved by replacing boolean flags (`is_running`, `is_finished`) with a single, more descriptive `game_phase` state (`SETUP`, `RUNNING`, `FINISHED`). This makes the game logic cleaner and more robust.
-   **Victory Reason Tracking:** The backend now records how the game ended (e.g., 'Max Turns Reached', 'Dominance', 'Extinction') and passes this information to the frontend.

### Frontend UI/UX (`main.js`, `style.css`)
-   **New Feature - Remove Team:** Users can now remove teams during the setup phase. A confirmation prompt prevents accidental deletion. This adds crucial flexibility to the game setup process.
-   **Redesigned Final Analysis Panel:** The final results table has been completely replaced with a modern, card-based layout.
    -   Each team receives its own styled "card" showing its name, color, final stats, and its generated divination text.
    -   This new layout is significantly easier to read and more aesthetically pleasing.
-   **Clearer Game Over Message:** The specific reason for the game's conclusion (e.g., "Game Over: Team 'Red' achieved dominance.") is now prominently displayed above the final analysis cards.
-   **Improved UI Logic:** The frontend code was updated to use the new `game_phase` state from the backend, simplifying UI update logic. The team list click/delete handling was also refactored for better performance and clarity.
