This iteration focused on critical code cleanup and bug fixing, addressing issues in both the frontend and backend.

1.  **Fixed JavaScript Code Duplication**: A large block of code containing the `illustrationHelpers` and `illustrationDrawers` objects was present in both `static/js/main.js` and `static/js/illustrations.js`. This duplication was noted in the previous iteration's log but the fix was not applied correctly. The duplicated code has now been properly removed from `main.js`. This resolves a bug where action illustrations in the guide would not display correctly (as the less complete definitions in `main.js` were overwriting the correct ones from `illustrations.js`) and significantly cleans up the main JavaScript file, improving maintainability.

2.  **Fixed Undefined Function Call**: A critical bug was found in `game_app/actions/fortify_actions.py` where the `_find_attunable_nexuses` function was calling a non-existent method `self.game._update_nexuses_for_team(teamId)`. This would have caused a crash whenever the game tried to check for the `attune_nexus` action. The call has been corrected to use the existing generic method `self.game._update_structures_for_team(teamId)`, which correctly updates all team structures, including nexuses, before checking for valid actions. This ensures the action precondition check works as intended.

These changes fix a frontend display bug, resolve a backend crashing bug, and improve the overall health and maintainability of the codebase.
