- **Illustration Review (RUNE actions):** Reviewed all `RUNE` actions for illustration coverage and quality.
- **Visual Design Streamlining & Consistency:**
    - **Improved `Rune: V-Beam` Illustration:** Added a thick, semi-transparent highlight to the V-Rune's lines, matching the visual effect used in the live game renderer to indicate an active rune.
    - **Improved `Rune: Impale` Illustration:** The illustration now shows the beam piercing through *two* enemy lines and causing explosions on both, which better demonstrates its "pierces all" nature described in the rules. The beam was also changed from an arrow to a thick line to better represent a continuous beam.
- **Live Renderer Improvement:**
    - **Added Rune Highlighters:** Created new visual highlighters in the live game renderer for several rune types that were previously not visually distinguished when active. This improves player feedback and consistency with other runes.
        - **Plus-Rune:** Now shows a glowing pulse from its center point.
        - **T-Rune:** Highlights its "stem" line.
        - **Parallelogram-Rune & Barricade-Rune:** Now show a visual highlight (fill or stroke) around their perimeter.
        - **Star-Rune:** Now has a pulsing glow around its central point.
- **Consistency Check:** The illustrations and in-game visuals for all `RUNE` actions are now more consistent, making it easier for players to understand which structure is performing an action.
