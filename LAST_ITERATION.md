- **Performance Optimization (Formation Checking):**
  - Replaced the `O(N^5)` brute-force pentagon search in `_find_possible_purifiers` with a more efficient algorithm.
  - The new approach builds potential pentagons up from corners (`p1-p2-p3`), using geometric constraints (side lengths, angles) to prune the search space significantly before searching for the remaining points.
  - This removes the need for a random sampling cap (e.g., checking only `500` combinations), making the Purifier formation check both faster and deterministic, ensuring it will always be found if it exists.
- **Code Cleanup:**
  - Removed an unreachable line of code from `_find_possible_monoliths_and_fallbacks`.
