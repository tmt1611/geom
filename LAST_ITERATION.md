- **Refactor (Python):** Reworked the `create_orbital` action handler in `game_app/actions/expand_actions.py`. The original implementation would fail if the team had fewer than 5 points, even though the precondition check correctly identified that a fallback action (strengthening lines) was possible. The refactored code now correctly attempts the primary effect if there are 5+ points, and executes the fallback logic if there are fewer than 5 points OR if the primary effect fails for geometric reasons. This makes the action's behavior consistent with its precondition check and improves overall robustness. I also extracted the fallback logic into a private helper method for better code clarity.
- **Consistency (Docs):** Corrected an inconsistency in `rules.md`. In the `Barricade-Rune` description, the unlocked action `Raise Barricade` was miscategorized with the `[TERRAFORM]` group tag. It is now correctly listed as `[RUNE]`, matching the implementation in `action_data.py` and its other mention in the document.
