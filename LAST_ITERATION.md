This iteration focuses on improving the user interface and experience, specifically for the "Action Guide" tab, and on cleaning up the visual presentation of the action illustrations.

### UI/UX Improvements: Action Guide

1.  **Compact Layout**: The Action Guide previously displayed all action cards in a single, long column. This was inefficient and required a lot of scrolling.
    *   I modified the CSS (`static/css/style.css`) to use a responsive grid layout for the `.action-guide-grid`. This now shows multiple cards per row, making the guide more compact and easier to browse.
    *   To further improve compactness, I reduced the width of the illustration canvas within each action card from 200px to 160px.

2.  **Cleaner Illustrations**: Many of the action illustrations used a text emoji ('ðŸ’¥') to represent explosions or impacts. This looked inconsistent and unprofessional.
    *   I created a new helper function, `drawExplosion`, in `static/js/main.js` to render a consistent, stylized starburst graphic.
    *   I replaced all instances of the explosion emoji across all relevant action illustrators with calls to this new helper function. This results in a cleaner, more visually cohesive, and professional-looking guide.

3.  **Visual Differentiation**: To help distinguish between similar-looking actions, I adjusted the size of the new explosion graphic for different actions. For example, the `rune_focus_beam` action now shows a larger explosion than the `rune_starlight_cascade`, visually communicating its higher impact.

These changes make the Action Guide more user-friendly, visually appealing, and easier to understand at a glance.
