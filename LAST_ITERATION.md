# Iteration Analysis and Changelog

## 1. Analysis Summary
The previous iteration focused on enriching gameplay with the "Convert Point" action and improving the setup workflow by allowing direct deletion of points. While successful, the application's UI had some quality-of-life limitations, particularly its fixed-size playing field, which didn't adapt to different screen sizes. The setup phase also lacked the ability to modify a team's properties after creation. This iteration addresses these UI shortcomings and introduces a new, visually distinct action to create more organic and unpredictable game boards.

## 2. Implemented Features and Improvements

### Major UI/UX Improvements
-   **Responsive Canvas (`style.css`, `main.js`):** The main game grid is no longer a fixed size. It now responsively scales to fit the available space in the user's browser window, while maintaining a 1:1 aspect ratio. This was achieved by:
    -   Updating CSS to use flexbox properties and `aspect-ratio` for the grid's container.
    -   Implementing a `ResizeObserver` in JavaScript to automatically detect container size changes and redraw the canvas with the correct dimensions and scaling.
-   **Editable Teams (`main.js`, `style.css`):** Users can now edit a team's name and color during the `SETUP` phase without needing to delete and recreate it.
    -   An "edit" icon has been added to each team in the list.
    -   Clicking the icon puts that team's list item into an "edit mode" with input fields and Save/Cancel buttons, improving the setup workflow.

### Gameplay & Backend (`game_logic.py`)
-   **New Action - Grow Line (Vine):** A new `EXPAND` action, `expand_action_grow_line`, has been added. This action allows a team to grow a new, short line segment from one of its existing points at a semi-random angle.
    -   This action is designed to create organic, branching, "vine-like" structures, leading to more visually complex and interesting patterns.
-   **Enhanced AI:** The new "Grow Line" action has been integrated into the team AI (`_choose_action_for_team`). It is heavily favored by the 'Expansive' trait, giving it a unique growth pattern compared to other teams.

### Documentation (`rules.md`)
-   The game rules have been updated to include a description of the new "Grow Line (Vine)" action.
