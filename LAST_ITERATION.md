Optimized and corrected action precondition checks to improve performance and adhere to the "action pool never empty" design principle.

1.  **Optimized `claim_territory` Precondition:** Replaced the expensive triangle enumeration in `can_perform_claim_territory` with a much cheaper check based on point and line counts, improving performance. The precise check remains in the action's execution logic.
2.  **Corrected `mirror_structure` Precondition:** The `can_perform_mirror_structure` check was too strict and only checked for the primary effect. It now correctly accounts for the action's fallback effects (strengthening or adding a line), making the action available more often as intended.
3.  **Corrected `create_ley_line` Precondition:** Simplified the `can_perform_create_ley_line` check. It now correctly allows the action if any I-Rune exists, as the action's implementation handles both creating a new ley line and pulsing an existing one.
4.  **Improved `mirror_structure` Fallback:** Added a unique log message for the final fallback case of the `mirror_structure` action where it creates a new line, distinguishing it from the standard `add_line` action for better log clarity.
