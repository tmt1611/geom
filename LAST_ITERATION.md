- **Bug Fix (Pyodide):** Corrected a critical issue in `static/js/api.js` where the Pyodide (WebAssembly) backend was failing to load several action handler modules (`fight_actions.py`, `sacrifice_actions.py`, `terraform_actions.py`). This would have caused the application to crash in static/GitHub Pages mode when certain actions were performed.
- **Refactoring & Optimization (Python):** Refactored the target selection logic for the `launch_payload` action in `fight_actions.py`. The new implementation is cleaner, uses efficient set operations to identify high-value targets, and correctly utilizes the centralized `_get_vulnerable_enemy_points` helper, avoiding redundant calculations.
- **Consistency (Python):** The `impale` rune action is described as a devastating, piercing attack. The implementation was updated in `rune_actions.py` to consistently pierce bastion defenses, aligning it with other powerful rune attacks and its description.
- **Consistency (Python):** Renamed the action key `fortify_mirror` to `fortify_mirror_structure` in `action_data.py` to better match its method name (`mirror_structure`) and display name. Corresponding result types were updated in `fortify_actions.py`.
- **Documentation (Markdown):** Updated `rules.md` to clarify that the `Attack Line` action will damage (weaken) a strengthened line rather than destroying it outright on the first hit.
- **Documentation (Python):** Updated the description for the `claim_territory` action in `action_data.py` to accurately reflect that it also reinforces the territory's boundary lines, matching the game rules.
