This iteration focused on improving the UI/UX of the Action Guide tab and performing minor code cleanup.

### 1. Action Guide Layout Improvement
- **`static/css/style.css`**: The layout of the Action Guide has been significantly improved to be more compact and readable.
    - Instead of a vertical card layout (illustration on top, text below), the cards now use a horizontal two-column layout (illustration on the left, text on the right).
    - This makes better use of horizontal space on wider screens, allowing more information to be visible at once without excessive scrolling.
    - The grid was adjusted to accommodate the new wider card format, resulting in a cleaner, more organized presentation of the actions.

### 2. Code Cleanup
- **`game_app/game_logic.py`**: Removed several unused imports (`is_rectangle`, `is_parallelogram`, `get_isosceles_triangle_info`) from the main game logic file. These geometric checks are handled by the `FormationManager`, so importing them into `game_logic.py` was redundant. This change reduces clutter and improves code clarity.
