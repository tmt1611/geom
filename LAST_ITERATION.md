- **UI (Randomize Points):** Replaced the `prompt` for randomizing points with a dedicated number input field in the setup UI. This provides a smoother, more integrated user experience (`index.html`, `static/js/main.js`, `static/css/style.css`).
- **UI (Narration Bar):** Restyled the status bar below the grid to have a semi-transparent white background and dark text, improving readability. Team names within the status message remain colored for easy identification (`static/css/style.css`).
- **UI (Game Log):** Reworked the game log's appearance. Team-specific entries now have a team-colored background with white text, while system/environment messages have a neutral background, making the log much easier to parse visually (`static/js/main.js`, `static/css/style.css`).
- **UI (Dev Tools):** Relocated the Developer Tools panel to the always-visible game log column. This makes the tools accessible during both the setup and game-running phases, satisfying the requirement without code duplication or complex DOM manipulation (`index.html`).
