- **Illustration Review (FIGHT & RUNE actions):** Added new illustrations for `Hull Breach`, `Isolate Point`, and `Gravity Well`, which were previously missing. This completes illustration coverage for all `FIGHT` actions and adds a missing `RUNE` action.
- **Illustration Design & Consistency:**
    - The new illustrations were designed to visually represent their mechanics: `Hull Breach` shows a convex hull converting an enemy, `Isolate Point` shows a debuffing beam, and `Gravity Well` shows a Star-Rune pushing enemies away.
    - Corrected several illustrations that incorrectly showed a "sacrifice" visual (a red 'X') for non-sacrifice actions:
        - `Rune: Starlight Cascade`
        - `Terraform: Form Rift Spire`
        - `Rune: Cardinal Pulse`
    - The "push" visual (outward arrows) for `Gravity Well` is now consistent with other push effects like `Shield Pulse`.
    - The "conversion" visual (halo) for `Hull Breach` is now consistent with `Convert Point`.
- **Visual Polish:** Improved the symbol for the `Build Wonder` action to look more like a distinct spire rather than a simple triangle.
- **Checked action coverage:** Confirmed that all `FIGHT` actions now have illustrations. One `RUNE` action (`Gravity Well`) was added.
