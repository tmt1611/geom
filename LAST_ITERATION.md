This iteration focuses on a significant code cleanup and a bugfix to align an action with the game's design principles.

1.  **Code Cleanup (JavaScript)**: The file `static/js/main.js` contained a large, duplicated block of code defining `illustrationHelpers` and `illustrationDrawers`. These objects are already defined in `static/js/illustrations.js`, which is loaded by the application. This redundant code has now been removed from `main.js`, significantly reducing its size and improving maintainability.

2.  **Bugfix (Python)**: The `nova_burst` sacrifice action was not correctly respecting the design rule that points belonging to critical structures (like Runes or Territories) cannot be sacrificed. The logic for finding an "ideal" target for the nova's primary effect was checking all of a team's points, bypassing the safety checks for critical points. This has been fixed by modifying `_find_possible_nova_bursts` to only consider non-critical points as potential candidates for sacrifice, ensuring the rule is always enforced for this action.
