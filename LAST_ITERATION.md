- **Refactor (JS):** Removed ~1700 lines of duplicated drawing and illustration code from `main.js` (`illustrationHelpers`, `illustrationDrawers`, and all `draw...` functions). This code is now solely managed by `illustrations.js` and `renderer.js`.
- **Refactor (JS):** Updated `main.js` to be a pure controller. It no longer performs any direct canvas rendering. Instead, it initializes and calls the `renderer` module in its animation loop.
- **Refactor (JS):** Simplified the animation loop in `main.js` by removing the `fullRender` function and calling `renderer.render()` directly.
- **Refactor (JS):** Standardized the internal API of `renderer.js`. All individual drawing functions (e.g., `drawPoints`, `drawTerritories`) now accept a consistent `(gameState, isHighlightingActive, uiState)` signature, making the renderer more maintainable.
- **Best Practice (JS):** Replaced the hardcoded, multi-signature drawing calls in `renderer.js`'s main `render` function with a clean, data-driven `renderLayers` array. This improves extensibility and readability.
