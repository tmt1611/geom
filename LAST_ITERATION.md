- **Illustration Review (FIGHT & FORTIFY actions):** Reviewed non-rune `FIGHT` and all `FORTIFY` actions for consistency.
- **Visual Effect Creation & Streamlining:**
    - **`Fight: Parallel Strike`**: Added a new visual effect (`parallel_strike` and `parallel_strike_miss_spawn`) using an `attack_ray` to match its illustration and provide in-game feedback.
    - **`Fight: Territory Tri-Beam`**: Added a new visual effect (`territory_tri_beam`) that fires three `attack_ray`s, aligning it with its name and illustration.
    - **`Fortify: Create Anchor`**: Enhanced the existing visual handler to include a `point_implosion` effect, giving better feedback for the point's transformation.
    - **`Rune: Focus Beam`**: Changed the visual effect from a `jagged_ray` (lightning) to a straight `attack_ray` (beam) to better align with the action's name and its existing illustration. This improves visual consistency across "beam" type attacks.
- **Consistency Check:** Verified that other actions in these categories already had consistent illustrations and visual effects.
