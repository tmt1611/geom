- **Improved Game Log Readability:** The text color for team-specific log entries now automatically adjusts to white or dark gray for optimal contrast against the team's colored background.
- **Enhanced Status Bar Narration:** The acting team's name in the status bar narration is now rendered in white, making it stand out against the team-colored text. Other mentioned team names still use their own colors.
- **Refined "Randomize Points" UI:** The controls for randomizing points on the setup screen have been visually grouped into a distinct component with a background and border for a clearer, more organized layout.
