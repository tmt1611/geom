This iteration focuses on improving the user interface and expanding the visual documentation in the "Action Guide" tab.

### 1. Redesigned Action Guide Layout

The layout of the "Action Guide" tab has been significantly improved for better readability and compactness. The previous multi-column grid has been replaced with a single-column list view. Action cards now feature a side-by-side layout, with the illustration on the left and the descriptive text on the right. This change makes better use of horizontal space, reduces vertical scrolling, and presents the information in a more organized and less cluttered manner.

### 2. New Illustration for "Raise Barricade"

To further enhance the visual guide, a new illustration has been developed for the `terraform_raise_barricade` action. The artwork clearly depicts the process: a four-point "Barricade Rune" is shown being consumed, which then results in the creation of a jagged, wall-like structure. This visual aid helps users quickly understand the cause-and-effect of this powerful terrain-altering action.
