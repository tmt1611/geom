Improved action robustness to reduce cases where actions can fail, in line with the "action pool never empty" design goal.

1.  **`hull_breach` Improvement**: Added a third-level fallback to the `hull_breach` action. If the primary effect (convert point) and secondary effect (reinforce hull lines) are not possible, the action will now emit a weak pulse to push nearby enemies away, preventing the action from failing if the hull is already complete and max-strength. Updated `action_data.py` with a new log generator and description for this outcome.

2.  **`parallel_strike` Fix**: Corrected the `parallel_strike` action logic. It no longer requires enemy points to be present to be considered a valid action, as its design includes creating a point on the border if it misses. This makes the action more reliable and always available as long as the team has a valid point/line combination.
