- **Illustration Review (FORTIFY Actions):** Added new illustrations for `Reposition Point` and `Create Ley Line`. Redesigned the illustration for `Mirror Structure` to better reflect its function of mirroring a structure rather than a single point.
- **Illustration Consistency:**
    - Renamed several illustration functions to match their action names in `rules.md` for better consistency (e.g., `fortify_claim` to `fortify_claim_territory`, `fortify_shield` to `fortify_shield_line`, etc.). This was applied to multiple action groups (Expand, Fight, Fortify, Sacrifice, Rune) to improve overall code clarity.
- **Visual Effect Streamlining:**
    - Unified the `bastion_formation` visual effect into the more generic `line_flash` effect, as they produced identical visuals. This simplifies the effect map in `visuals.js` and `renderer.js`.
    - Corrected the visualizer for the no-cost `Create Anchor` action by removing erroneous logic that checked for a sacrificed point.
- **Checked action coverage:** Ensured all `FORTIFY` actions now have corresponding illustration code in `illustration_generator.js`, except for `Overcharge` which is a variant of `Shield Line`.
