- **Implemented Simulation Progress Visual:** Added a loading overlay that appears after clicking "Start Game".
  - When running with Pyodide (in-browser), the simulation is now processed asynchronously in chunks. This prevents the UI from freezing and allows a progress bar to display the simulation's advancement turn-by-turn.
  - When running with the standard Python server, a simple "Simulating..." message is shown, as detailed progress streaming is not supported by the current architecture.
- **Code Refactoring:** Created a new `api.startGameAsync` method to handle the asynchronous simulation, separating it cleanly from the original synchronous method which is still used by developer tools. This improves code organization and maintains existing functionality.
- **Feature Review:** Confirmed that other requested features (explicit point randomization, action previews, log coloring, dev tools visibility, step-back controls, and status bar text styling) are already implemented and functioning as intended.
