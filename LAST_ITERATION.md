- **Illustration Review (FIGHT actions):** Reviewed all `FIGHT` actions for visual consistency between illustrations and in-game effects.
- **Code Optimization & Consistency:**
    - Created a new `drawSpiral` helper function in `illustration_generator.js` to standardize the drawing of curved, energetic paths.
    - Refactored the `sacrifice_create_whirlpool` illustration to use this new helper.
- **Visual Design Streamlining & Consistency:**
    - **Added `is_isolated` point rendering:** Implemented a new visual state in `renderer.js` for isolated points, making them appear with a purple 'X' cage. This brings the in-game visual in line with the `fight_isolate_point` illustration.
    - **Improved `Fight: Hull Breach` Illustration:** Replaced the simple arrow with the new `drawSpiral` effect to better match the `energy_spiral` visual effect used for conversion in-game.
    - **Improved `Fight: Sentry Zap` Illustration:** Replaced the straight arrow with a `drawJaggedLine` to better represent an electrical "zap" and match its corresponding `jagged_ray` visual effect.
- **Visual Effect Improvements:**
    - **`Fight: Attack Line`:** Added a `point_explosion` visual effect upon impact to match its illustration.
    - **`Fight: Refraction Beam`:** Added a `point_explosion` visual effect upon final impact to match its illustration.
    - **`Fight: Purify Territory`:** Added a radiating shockwave visual effect from the purifier structure to match its illustration.
- **Consistency Check:** The illustrations and in-game visuals for several `FIGHT` actions are now more closely aligned, improving clarity and visual consistency.
