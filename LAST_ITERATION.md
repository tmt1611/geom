This iteration focuses on a significant overhaul of the user interface and layout to address several usability issues and better align with the game's phases.

### 1. Unified Layout for All Game Phases

The game now uses a consistent CSS grid layout from the moment it loads, instead of switching from flexbox to grid. This resolves an issue where the game grid was incorrectly sized (often too large for the screen) during the initial setup phase. The main container is now a four-column grid, providing a stable structure for all panels and content.

### 2. Improved Setup Phase Ergonomics

The setup controls, previously consolidated into a single left-hand panel, have been logically split. The "Create Teams" panel now resides in a new column to the left of the grid. The "Place Points" and "Game Settings" controls have been moved to a new column to the right of the grid. This provides a more balanced and intuitive workflow: create teams on the left, place points on the right, with the grid central.

### 3. Redesigned "Game Finished" State

When a game concludes, the "Action Preview" column (which becomes empty) is now repurposed to display the final game statistics and interpretation. The end-game analysis panel has been moved from the far-left column to this more prominent central-right position, making the results easier to view and analyze. A new `body.game-finished` CSS class manages this transition seamlessly.

### 4. Optimized Action Preview Panel

The list of possible actions in the "Action Preview" panel has been made more vertically compact. The font size and spacing for action categories and individual actions have been reduced. This change aims to display all valid actions for a team at once, eliminating the need for vertical scrolling and providing a better at-a-glance overview of a team's potential moves.

These changes collectively create a cleaner, more professional, and user-friendly experience across all three phases of the game.
