- **Refactor (Python):** Reworked the `create_orbital` action handler in `game_app/actions/expand_actions.py`. It now correctly handles cases with fewer than 5 points by executing its fallback logic (reinforcing nearby lines) instead of failing prematurely. This makes the action's implementation consistent with its precondition check and improves overall robustness.
- **Consistency (Docs):** Corrected an inconsistency in `rules.md`. The `Raise Barricade` action was miscategorized with the `[TERRAFORM]` group tag in the `Barricade-Rune` description. It is now correctly listed as `[RUNE]`, matching the implementation in `action_data.py` and its other mention in the document.
