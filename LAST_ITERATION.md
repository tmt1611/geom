- **Illustration Review (FIGHT Actions):** Added new illustrations for `Parallel Strike` and `Territory Tri-Beam` to ensure all Fight actions have visual representations in the guide.
- **Illustration Consistency:**
    - Renamed several illustration functions (`fight_bastion_pulse`, `fight_chain_lightning`, etc.) to correctly match their action group (e.g., `sacrifice_bastion_pulse`). This improves code clarity and consistency with `rules.md`.
    - Standardized the visual language for attack illustrations, using consistent arrow and explosion styles.
- **Visual Effect Fix:** Corrected a bug in the renderer's `switch` statement where a duplicate case label for `animated_ray` existed, clarifying the logic for rendering different types of beam effects.
- **Checked action coverage:** Ensured all actions in the "Fight" group now have corresponding illustration code in `illustration_generator.js`.
