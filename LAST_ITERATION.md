- **Refactoring (Readability & Maintainability):**
  - Refactored multiple complex lambda functions used for action preconditions in `action_data.py`.
  - Removed the unpythonic `(var := value, (result))[1]` tuple-indexing trick used to assign variables inside lambdas.
  - Replaced these with more conventional and readable constructs:
    - For simple checks, a direct ternary expression is now used (e.g., `fight_parallel_strike`, `fortify_claim`).
    - For more complex checks that required intermediate variables to avoid re-computation, a nested lambda was used as a readable and efficient alternative (e.g., `fortify_anchor`, `rune_hourglass_stasis`, `sacrifice_attune_nexus`).
  - This significantly improves the readability and maintainability of the central action data definitions without sacrificing performance.
