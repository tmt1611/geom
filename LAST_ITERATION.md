- **Action System & Rules Reorganization:** Reworked the entire `rules.md` documentation to be structured around action conditions. Actions are now grouped by the specific geometric or structural prerequisites a team must meet to perform them (e.g., "Condition: Team has at least 2 points", "Condition: Team has a V-Rune"). This makes the action system clearer and more logical.
- **Action Verification (Expand Group):** Reviewed all actions in the `Expand` group. Verified that their Python implementations correctly match their descriptions, that their precondition checks are accurate and robust, and that their visualizations are distinct and correctly triggered.
- **Documentation Clarity:** Added a "Sacrifice Mechanics" section to `rules.md` to explain the point regeneration system, improving player understanding of the mechanic.
