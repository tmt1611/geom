This iteration delivers a mix of a critical bug fix, a code refactoring, and a user interface enhancement.

1.  **Critical Bugfix for Static/Pyodide Mode**: A major issue was discovered in `static/js/api.js` where the Pyodide (WebAssembly) backend was not loading all the necessary Python action handler files. Specifically, `rune_actions.py` and `sacrifice_actions.py` were missing from the list of files to be loaded into the virtual filesystem. This would have caused the application to crash when running in static mode (e.g., on GitHub Pages) as soon as a Rune or Sacrifice action was attempted. This has been corrected by adding the missing files to the load list, ensuring the static version of the game is fully functional.

2.  **Code Refactoring for Cleanliness**: In `game_logic.py`, the complex logic for identifying all points belonging to various rune structures was scattered and difficult to maintain due to inconsistent data structures. To clean this up, a new helper method, `_get_all_rune_point_ids`, was created. This method encapsulates the logic for parsing all rune types. The original logic inside `_find_non_critical_sacrificial_point` has been replaced with a single call to this new, clean helper function, improving code readability and maintainability.

3.  **UI Improvement for Action Guide**: To address the user's request for a more compact Action Guide, several minor CSS adjustments were made in `static/css/style.css`. The minimum width of action cards was reduced, and internal padding, gaps, and font sizes were tweaked. These changes result in a slightly tighter and more information-dense layout, allowing more actions to be visible on screen at once.
