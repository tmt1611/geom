This iteration focuses on a deep refactoring of the game's action logic to provide more accurate UI feedback, the introduction of a new strategic "Barricade" rune and terrain-altering mechanics, and a significant overhaul of visual effects to make the game more dynamic and engaging.

### 1. Enhanced Action Pre-computation and UI Feedback

-   **Files**: `game_app/game_logic.py`
-   **Change**: The core action logic has been refactored. For complex actions like `fight_attack`, `expand_extend`, `pincer_attack`, and `claim_territory`, the logic for finding valid targets has been separated into dedicated helper methods (e.g., `_find_possible_line_attacks`, `_find_claimable_triangles`).
-   **Benefit**: This refactoring accomplishes two major goals:
    1.  **Cleaner Code**: Action functions are now shorter and more focused on execution, improving maintainability.
    2.  **Smarter UI**: The "Action Preview" panel now uses this pre-computation to give users a much more accurate assessment of an action's validity. Instead of just knowing a team *can* attack, the UI now knows if there's an actual, viable target in range, and will correctly show the action as invalid if no such target exists. This fulfills a key feature request for more detailed action analysis.

### 2. New Rune and Terrain Mechanic: The Barricade

-   **Files**: `game_app/game_logic.py`, `static/js/main.js`, `rules.md`
-   **Change**: A new "Barricade" rune and a corresponding `[TERRAFORM] Raise Barricade` action have been introduced.
    -   **Formation**: The rune is formed by four points creating a rectangle with all four of its sides connected by lines.
    -   **Action**: Consumes the rune to create a temporary, impassable **Barricade** on the field. This wall, rendered as a jagged, rocky line, blocks most line-of-sight based actions (like `Attack Line` and `Extend Line`) for several turns, introducing a powerful new element of battlefield control.
    -   **System Impact**: The game engine now checks for intersections with barricades, and they decay over time. The frontend can now render these new objects.
-   **Benefit**: This adds a new layer of strategy, allowing defensive teams to create chokepoints and protect key structures, while forcing aggressive teams to navigate or wait out these new obstacles.

### 3. Diverse and Stunning New Visual Effects

-   **Files**: `static/js/main.js`
-   **Change**: Many actions that previously only highlighted affected elements now have unique, dynamic animations, making the game more visually rich and intuitive.
    -   **`Extend Line`**: Now visualized with a directed beam of light shooting from the origin point to the new point on the border. Empowered extensions from Conduits are thicker and more impressive.
    -   **`Fracture Line`**: The original line now visibly "cracks" with a small particle burst at the fracture point before fading out as the two new lines fade in.
    -   **`Claim Territory`**: The triangular territory now fills with the team's color using an animated "wipe" effect, making the act of claiming land more impactful.
    -   **`Create Orbital`**: New points now animate, spiraling outwards from the central point to their final positions.
    -   **`Raise Barricade`**: The new action is accompanied by an animation of a rocky wall growing in size, opacity, and jaggedness from the ground up.
-   **Benefit**: These new effects make the simulation far more engaging to watch and provide clearer, more immediate visual feedback for what each action accomplishes.

### 4. Codebase Cleanup and Documentation

-   **Files**: `game_logic.py`, `rules.md`, `LAST_ITERATION.md`
-   **Change**: Added the new `barricade` object to the game state and ensured it is properly initialized, managed, and sent to the client. Updated the `rules.md` to document the new Barricade Rune and its action. Logged all changes in `LAST_ITERATION.md`.
