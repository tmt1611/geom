- **Illustration Review (SACRIFICE actions):** Reviewed all `SACRIFICE` action illustrations. All were found to be present, clear, and consistent with action descriptions. No changes were made.
- **Visual Effects Review (SACRIFICE actions):**
    - Reviewed all `SACRIFICE` actions for visual effects. All actions had an effect, but two were identified for significant improvement to better match their in-game impact.
    - **Improved `Build Wonder` (`build_chronos_spire`):** The visual effect was changed from a simple `point_implosion` to a much more dramatic sequence. It now reuses the `heartwood_creation` effect to show energy from all sacrificed Star-Rune points converging on the center, followed by a `starlight_cascade` flash as the Wonder appears. This better reflects the creation of a game-winning structure.
    - **Improved `Bastion Pulse`:** The original effect only showed the sacrificed point imploding. The new effect is more comprehensive: it now includes a `polygon_flash` over the bastion's area to show it activating, a `point_implosion` for the sacrifice, and `point_explosion` effects on all enemy lines that are destroyed by the pulse, providing full visual feedback for the action's outcome.
- **Checked action coverage:** Confirmed all `SACRIFICE` actions have appropriate and clear visual effects, improving game clarity and engagement.
