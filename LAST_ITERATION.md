- **Status Bar Narration:** Modified the status bar at the bottom of the grid. It now displays the text of the last team-based log message in that team's color, improving visual feedback. The background remains white, and any team names mentioned within the text are still colored appropriately.
- **Game Log Styling:** Differentiated between direct team actions and environmental events in the game log. Direct actions retain their team-colored background. Environmental events (like point regeneration, structure decay, etc.) now have a default light background, but with a team-colored left border to maintain a visual connection to the relevant team. This makes the log clearer and easier to read.
- **Backend Log Data:** Updated the backend logic in `turn_processor.py` and `game_logic.py` to add contextual `teamId` and a new `is_event` flag to all turn-based event log messages. This provides the necessary data for the improved frontend styling.
