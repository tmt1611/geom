This iteration focuses on two key areas: refactoring the Python codebase for cleaner code and improving the user interface of the "Action Guide" tab for a more compact and readable layout.

1.  **Code Refactoring (ID Generation)**: To reduce code duplication and improve maintainability, a new helper method `_generate_id(prefix)` has been added to the main `Game` class in `game_logic.py`. Previously, unique IDs for game objects (like points, lines, and structures) were generated using formatted strings with `uuid.uuid4()` scattered across all five action handler files. This has now been centralized. All instances of this manual ID creation have been replaced with calls to the new helper method (e.g., `self.game._generate_id('p')`), making the code cleaner and ensuring a consistent ID format throughout the application.

2.  **UI Improvement (Action Guide)**: The "Action Guide" tab has been redesigned to be more compact, allowing more actions to be visible on screen simultaneously. The following changes were made:
    *   The size of the illustration canvas for each action card was reduced from `150x120px` to `120x100px`.
    *   The minimum width of action cards in the grid was decreased from `380px` to `340px`.
    *   Padding, gaps, and font sizes within the action cards were slightly reduced to tighten the layout.
    *   The JavaScript code responsible for rendering the illustrations was updated to draw correctly on the new, smaller canvas dimensions.

These changes result in a cleaner codebase and a more user-friendly and efficient layout for the action reference guide.
