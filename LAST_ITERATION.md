# Iteration Analysis and Changelog

## 1. Analysis Summary
The previous iteration successfully introduced the "Anchor" point, adding a new layer of strategic area control. The application is stable and the UI is functional. Based on the project goals, the next logical step is to add more creative, geometry-based actions that can produce visually stunning results. Additionally, a minor code duplication bug was identified in the frontend JavaScript (`main.js`).

## 2. Implemented Features and Improvements

### Gameplay & Backend (`game_logic.py`)
-   **New Action - Mirror Structure:** A new `FORTIFY` action has been introduced to create symmetrical patterns.
    -   A team selects two of its points to define an axis of symmetry.
    -   It then reflects some of its other points across this axis to create new, mirrored points.
    -   This action can lead to complex and visually beautiful geometric structures, enhancing both the auto-battle and divination aspects of the game.
-   **AI Integration:** The new "Mirror Structure" action has been added to the AI's decision-making process. The `Expansive` trait has a higher affinity for this action, as it promotes structural growth.
-   **Logging:** The game log now provides descriptive messages for both successful and failed "Mirror Structure" attempts.

### Frontend & UI (`main.js`)
-   **CRITICAL FIX:** Removed a duplicated `resizeCanvas` function, cleaning up the code and preventing potential bugs.
-   **Mirror Visualization:** To give users clear feedback, the "Mirror Structure" action is now visualized. When it occurs, the axis of symmetry is temporarily drawn on the canvas as a dashed line, and the newly created points are highlighted.

### Documentation (`rules.md`)
-   The game rules have been updated to include a description of the new "Mirror Structure" action.
