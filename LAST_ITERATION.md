This iteration focuses on improving the user experience of the Action Guide tab and performing several code cleanup tasks in both the Python backend and JavaScript frontend.

### UI/UX Improvements: Action Guide

1.  **More Compact Layout:** The Action Guide has been made more space-efficient.
    *   The action cards are now smaller (`120px` height vs `140px`).
    *   The grid layout has been adjusted to allow more cards to fit on the screen at once (`minmax(350px, 1fr)` vs `380px`).
    *   This was achieved by modifying `static/css/style.css` and updating the canvas dimensions in `static/js/main.js`.
2.  **Improved Header Controls:** The search bar and group filter buttons in the Action Guide header are now arranged on a single, responsive row, making better use of horizontal space.

### Code Cleanup and Refactoring

1.  **DRY Principle in `expand_actions.py`:** The `_find_possible_extensions` method contained duplicated logic for checking valid line extensions. This has been refactored into a new helper method, `_check_and_add_extension`, simplifying the original method and improving maintainability.
2.  **Consistent Logic in `fortify_actions.py`:** The fallback logic in the `claim_territory` action (for reinforcing an existing territory) was reimplementing code that already existed as a helper (`game._strengthen_line`). The code has been updated to use the shared helper, ensuring consistent behavior with other similar actions.
3.  **JavaScript Cleanup:** A copy-paste error in `static/js/main.js` resulted in several duplicated illustration functions. These duplicates have been removed.
