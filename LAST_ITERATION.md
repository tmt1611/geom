- **Optimization (Python):** Refactored several computationally expensive action precondition checks in `game_app/actions/fortify_actions.py`.
    - `can_perform_form_monolith` and `can_perform_form_purifier` no longer perform expensive geometric calculations (iterating through combinations of points) just to check if the action is possible. They now use a much faster, simplified check based on the minimum number of points required. The full geometric validation is still performed within the action handler itself, ensuring correctness without slowing down the action selection process.
- **Refactor (Python):** Simplified the precondition logic for `can_perform_mirror_structure` in `game_app/actions/fortify_actions.py`. The original check was verbose; the new logic is more concise and readable while covering the same conditions (the ability to mirror, strengthen a line, or add a new line).
- **Consistency (Docs):** Corrected an inconsistency in `rules.md`. In the `Barricade-Rune` description, the unlocked action was incorrectly tagged as `[TERRAFORM]`. It has been changed to `[RUNE]` to match the implementation and the main action list.
- **Cleanup (JS):** Removed dead code from `static/js/illustrations.js`. An entry for an `expand_grow` action illustration was present, but this action does not exist in the game's logic (`action_data.py`), so the unused code has been deleted.
