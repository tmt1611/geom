# Iteration Analysis and Changelog

## 1. Analysis Summary
The previous iteration successfully introduced team traits, adding strategic diversity to the game. The core gameplay loop was solid, but the visual feedback for actions was minimal, and the UI, while functional, could be enhanced. The `design.md` emphasizes a "highly visually interesting" and "visually impressive" experience, presenting a clear opportunity for improvement. The debug tools were also limited, only showing point IDs.

This iteration focuses heavily on improving the visual feedback of game events and enhancing the user's ability to understand and debug the simulation's flow.

## 2. Implemented Features and Improvements

### Frontend Visuals & UI/UX (`main.js`, `index.html`, `style.css`)
-   **New Feature - Advanced Action Visuals:** The application now provides immediate, animated feedback for key game actions:
    -   **Attack Action:** When an attack occurs, a bright red "ray" is now animated, shooting from the attacker to the target, making combat much more dynamic and clear.
    -   **Nova Burst & New Line:** Existing animations for these events were preserved and integrated into the new effects system.
-   **New Feature - Last Action Highlighting:** A new debug tool allows the user to enable highlighting for the most recent action. When enabled, any points or lines involved in the last turn's action are surrounded by a bright yellow halo for a few seconds, making it easy to follow the turn-by-turn progression.
-   **New Feature - Status Bar:** A status bar has been added to the bottom of the grid. It displays the latest log message (e.g., "Team Red attacked Team Blue"), providing immediate, easy-to-read context for the current action without needing to scan the full log.
-   **UI Reorganization:**
    -   The debug toggles have been moved into their own organized `<fieldset>` in the analysis panel.
    -   The grid container is now `position: relative` to properly anchor the new status bar.

### Debugging Support
-   **Show Line IDs:** A new debug option was added to display the unique ID of every line on the grid, complementing the existing "Show Point IDs" feature. This is invaluable for debugging complex geometric interactions.
-   **Combined Debug Panel:** All debug options ("Show Point IDs", "Show Line IDs", "Highlight Last Action") are now grouped together for convenience.

### Backend (`game_logic.py`)
-   **Enhanced Action Data:** The `fight_action_attack_line` action now returns more detailed information to the frontend, including the coordinates of the "attack ray" itself. This was crucial for enabling the new attack animation on the frontend without changing core game rules.
