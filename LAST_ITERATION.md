This iteration focuses on improving the UI of the "Action Guide" tab and cleaning up the illustrations for consistency.

### UI Improvement: Action Guide Layout

1.  **Compact Grid Layout:** The Action Guide has been changed from a single vertical list to a responsive grid. This makes the layout more compact and allows users to see more actions at once without excessive scrolling.
2.  **Improved Card Design:** The action cards within the guide now feature a top-down design. The illustration is placed prominently at the top, occupying the full width of the card, with the title and description below. This gives more space to the visuals and creates a cleaner presentation.
3.  **Larger Illustrations:** To accommodate the new layout and improve clarity, the canvas size for each illustration has been increased from `200x120` to `300x180`.

### Code Cleanup: Illustration Consistency

1.  **Standardized Visuals:** The font size for the "explosion" (üí•) and "heart" (‚ù§) symbols used across multiple action illustrations has been standardized. This ensures a more consistent and polished look throughout the guide.

These changes address the user's request to make the Action Guide more compact, better presented, and less cluttered, while also performing minor code cleanup for visual consistency.
