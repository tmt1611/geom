- **Illustration Review (RUNE & TERRAFORM actions):** Reviewed all `RUNE` and `TERRAFORM` actions for illustration coverage and design. All actions were found to have illustrations.
- **Visual Design Streamlining:**
    - **Improved `Rune: Impale` Illustration:** The illustration was updated to include a thick, blurred highlight over the Trident-Rune's shape. This change makes the illustration more visually impressive and aligns it with the highlight style used by the live game renderer for active runes, improving consistency.
    - **Improved `Rune: Focus Beam` Illustration:** The illustration's target, a Bastion core, was changed from a diamond shape to a square with a white border. This aligns the illustration with the specific visual used for Bastion cores in the game renderer, ensuring this important structure is represented consistently.
- **Visual Effects Review (RUNE & TERRAFORM actions):** All visual effects were reviewed and found to be clear, impactful, and consistent. No changes were needed.
- **Checked action coverage:** Confirmed all `RUNE` and `TERRAFORM` actions have illustrations and appropriate visual effects, enhancing UI consistency.
