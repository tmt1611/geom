- **Action Review (Sacrifice):** Reviewed all `Sacrifice` actions. Corrected the condition for `Convert Point` in `rules.md` to "Team has at least 1 line to sacrifice" to accurately reflect its implementation (it prefers non-critical lines but can use any line as a fallback).
- **Visualization Implementation (Hull Breach):** Implemented new visual effects for the `Hull Breach` action and its fallbacks in `visuals.js`. This includes a flashing polygon for the hull, an energy spiral for point conversion, flashes for line reinforcement/creation, and a pulse effect for the push fallback, ensuring this action now provides clear visual feedback to the user.
- **General Review (Fortify):** Reviewed the `Fortify` action group, confirming their conditions and implementations are consistent with their descriptions in `rules.md`. No major changes were needed.
