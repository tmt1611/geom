# Iteration Analysis and Changelog

## 1. Analysis Summary
This iteration focuses on a significant expansion of the game's strategic depth and visual complexity by introducing a "Rune" system, as suggested in the design goals. The goal is to make the auto-battle more interesting by rewarding teams for forming specific geometric patterns, moving beyond simple expansion.

## 2. Implemented Features and Improvements

### Rune System (`game_logic.py`)
A new core mechanic, **Runes**, has been implemented. Runes are geometric patterns that grant teams passive bonuses or unlock unique, powerful actions. The game now checks for these patterns for each team before it acts.

1.  **V-Rune (New Action):**
    - **Condition:** Three points forming a 'V' shape with two connected lines of similar length.
    - **Reward:** Unlocks a new high-priority action: `Rune Action: Shoot Bisector`. This action fires a powerful attack ray along the angle bisector of the 'V', capable of destroying an enemy line.
2.  **Cross-Rune (New Passive):**
    - **Condition:** Four points forming a rectangle, with both internal diagonals existing as lines.
    - **Reward:** Grants a passive ability: `Piercing Attacks`. Any standard `attack_line` action performed by the team can now bypass one enemy shield.

### Frontend and Visualization (`static/js/main.js`, `templates/index.html`)

1.  **Rune Visualization:** Active runes are now drawn directly on the canvas.
    - V-Runes are highlighted with a glowing effect along their two-line shape.
    - Cross-Runes are visualized by shading the rectangular area they form.
2.  **UI Updates:**
    - The "Live Stats" panel now displays a count of active `V-Shape` and `Cross` runes for each team.
    - The game log has been updated with new messages for the rune action and for shield-bypassing attacks.
3.  **New Visual Effects:** A distinct visual effect has been added for the `Shoot Bisector` attack ray to differentiate it from normal attacks.

### Documentation (`rules.md`)
- The `rules.md` file has been updated to include detailed explanations of the new runes and their effects.
