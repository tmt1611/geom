This iteration focused on two areas: improving the UI of the Action Guide tab and refactoring duplicated code for better maintainability and clarity.

### 1. Action Guide Compactness
- **`static/css/style.css` & `static/js/main.js`**: The Action Guide cards have been made more compact.
    - The card width was reduced from `450px` to `400px`, and the illustration canvas was resized from `180x120` to `150x100`.
    - This allows more action cards to be visible on the screen at once, especially on wider monitors, reducing the need for scrolling.

### 2. Code Refactoring & Simplification
- **`game_app/game_logic.py`**: Several helper methods were simplified using Python comprehensions for conciseness and better readability.
    - `_get_fortified_point_ids()` was converted into a single set comprehension.
    - `_get_bastion_point_ids()` was refactored to use set comprehensions, making the code shorter and more expressive.
- **`game_app/formations.py`**: A new helper method `_find_all_triangles` was created to centralize the logic for detecting all triangular formations for a team. This logic was previously duplicated in three different places.
- **`game_app/actions/fortify_actions.py` & `game_app/game_logic.py` & `game_app/formations.py`**: The duplicated triangle-finding logic was removed and replaced with calls to the new `formation_manager._find_all_triangles` method. This reduces code duplication, fixes a source of potential bugs, and makes the codebase easier to maintain.
