This iteration focuses on improving the user experience through better feedback and robustness. I've introduced a comprehensive frontend error handling system to help with debugging and stability, added more visual polish to make actions clearer, and enhanced the "Live Stats" panel to provide a more complete overview of the game state.

### 1. New Feature: Frontend Error Handling and Debugging

-   **Files**: `static/js/main.js`, `static/css/style.css`, `templates/index.html`
-   **Change**: A new client-side error handling system has been implemented.
    -   A global error handler (`window.onerror`) now catches any unhandled Javascript exceptions.
    -   When an error occurs, the game's auto-play is immediately stopped, and a modal overlay appears, preventing further interaction with a broken state.
    -   The modal displays the error message and stack trace. Crucially, it includes a **"Copy Details"** button, allowing users (or developers) to easily copy the full error text to their clipboard for reporting or debugging.
-   **Benefit**: This makes the application significantly more robust. Instead of silently failing or behaving unpredictably, errors are now caught and clearly presented. This is a major improvement for debugging and for getting useful feedback from users if something goes wrong.

### 2. Visual Polish: Point Destruction Animations

-   **File**: `static/js/main.js`
-   **Change**: Several actions that destroy or sacrifice points now have corresponding visual feedback, making the cause-and-effect of these powerful moves much clearer.
    -   **New Effect**: A `point_implosion` visual effect was created for sacrificial actions. It shows a point shrinking and fading out, visually distinct from an aggressive explosion.
    -   **Updated Actions**:
        -   `Sentry Zap`: Now triggers a `point_explosion` on its target, in addition to the attack beam.
        -   `Create Whirlpool`: The sacrificed point now triggers a `point_implosion`.
        -   `Create Anchor`: The sacrificed point now triggers a `point_implosion`.
        -   `Bastion Pulse`: The sacrificed "prong" point now triggers a `point_implosion`.
-   **Benefit**: The battlefield is more dynamic and legible. Users can now instantly see the cost (the sacrificed point disappearing) and the effect of an action, improving the overall visual narrative of the game.

### 3. UI Improvement: Comprehensive Live Stats

-   **File**: `static/js/main.js`
-   **Change**: The "Live Stats" panel in the UI has been significantly upgraded to show a complete list of all active special structures for each team.
    -   Previously, it only showed counts for Runes and Prisms.
    -   Now, it also displays real-time counts for **Bastions, Sentries, Conduits, and Nexuses**.
-   **Benefit**: This provides players with a much better at-a-glance understanding of each team's strategic assets and strengths during the simulation, making the game easier to follow and analyze in real-time.
