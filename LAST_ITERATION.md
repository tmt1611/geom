# Iteration Analysis and Changelog

## 1. Analysis Summary
This iteration addresses a critical bug that caused the server to crash when running a game turn. The traceback provided in the prompt pointed to a `NameError` in the `game_logic.py` file. The root cause was the use of the `combinations` function without importing it from the `itertools` library.

## 2. Bug Fix
- **File:** `game_app/game_logic.py`
- **Change:** Added `from itertools import combinations` to the top of the file.
- **Result:** This resolves the `NameError` and allows the `_check_cross_rune` function to execute correctly, preventing the server from crashing when a team's turn is processed.
