# Iteration Analysis and Changelog

## 1. Analysis Summary
The goal of this iteration is to improve the initial user experience by providing a quicker start. Many users might be impatient to set up teams from scratch. By pre-populating the game with two default teams, "Team Alpha" and "Team Beta," the user can immediately start interacting with the application by placing points on the grid. This lowers the barrier to entry and makes the app more inviting.

## 2. Implemented Features and Improvements

### Backend (`game_logic.py`)
-   **Default Teams:** The `Game.reset()` method has been modified to initialize the game state with two default teams: "Team Alpha" (Aggressive, red) and "Team Beta" (Defensive, blue).
-   **Consistent IDs:** These teams are created with fixed, unique IDs to ensure they are handled consistently by the frontend.
-   **Welcome Message:** An initial log message is added to welcome the user and guide them on what to do next.

### Frontend & User Experience (`static/js/main.js`)
-   **Quick Start:** On initial load or after a game reset, the default teams are now fetched from the server and displayed in the teams list, ready for use.
-   **Auto-Selection:** To further streamline the user's first actions, the first team in the list ("Team Alpha") is automatically selected. This allows the user to start placing points immediately without needing to click on a team first.
-   **Data Consistency:** The `addTeam` function was updated to include the `id` within the team object itself, making the data structure consistent between frontend-created teams and the new backend-default teams.
