- **Refactoring & Optimization (Formations):**
    - Identified duplicated code for finding rectangular point formations across multiple files (`formations.py`, `fortify_actions.py`).
    - Created a new, efficient helper method `find_all_rectangles` in `FormationManager` to centralize this logic. This method uses a graph-based approach to find all connected rectangles for a team.
    - Refactored several formation checking methods (`check_nexuses`, `check_barricade_rune`) and an action precondition helper (`_find_possible_monoliths_and_fallbacks`) to use the new centralized helper.
    - This change reduces code duplication, improves maintainability, and ensures consistent logic for rectangle detection throughout the application.
