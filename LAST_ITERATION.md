This iteration focuses on improving the user experience during the game setup phase. I've enhanced the team editing feature to provide more control and streamlined the game reset process to be faster and less disruptive.

### 1. New Feature: Comprehensive Team Editing

-   **Files**: `static/js/main.js`, `static/css/style.css`
-   **Change**: The team editing feature, accessible during the setup phase, has been upgraded. Previously, users could only edit a team's name and color. Now, they can also change the team's **Trait** (e.g., 'Aggressive', 'Defensive') from the same edit interface.
-   **Benefit**: This provides users with more flexibility and control over their game configuration. They no longer need to delete and re-create a team just to change its behavior, which makes the setup process faster and more intuitive.

### 2. UI Improvement: Seamless Game Reset

-   **File**: `static/js/main.js`
-   **Change**: The "Reset Game (New Setup)" button's functionality has been significantly improved. Instead of forcing a full page reload, the button now triggers a soft reset. It communicates with the server to reset the game state and then dynamically updates all UI components on the client-side without a refresh.
-   **Benefit**: This creates a much smoother and more professional user experience. The transition from a finished or running game back to the setup screen is now seamless and instant, eliminating the jarring effect of a page reload and reinforcing the application's single-page feel.
