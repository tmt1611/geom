# Iteration Analysis and Changelog

## 1. Analysis Summary
The previous iteration was successful in enhancing visual feedback and debugging tools, making the simulation much easier to follow. The core gameplay was solid, but user control over the simulation's setup and pacing was limited. The team AI, while functional, was static and would often attempt impossible actions (e.g., attacking with no lines), leading to repetitive and uninteresting log entries.

This iteration focuses on giving the user more strategic control during setup, improving the user experience during playback, and making the team AI more intelligent and adaptive to the game's state.

## 2. Implemented Features and Improvements

### Frontend UI/UX (`index.html`, `main.js`, `style.css`)
-   **New Feature - Team Trait Selection:** Users can now choose a strategic trait ('Aggressive', 'Expansive', 'Defensive', 'Balanced') for each team they create. This replaces the previous system of assigning a random trait, giving users direct control over the simulation's parameters and adding a layer of strategy to the setup phase.
-   **New Feature - Auto-Play Speed Control:** An interactive speed slider has been added to the "Game In Progress" controls. Users can now adjust the delay between turns during auto-play, from a rapid 50ms to a deliberate 1000ms. The slider updates the speed in real-time, allowing users to slow down for interesting moments or speed through quiet periods.
-   **UI Refinement:** The team creation and game control sections of the UI were updated to cleanly incorporate these new features.

### Backend & AI (`game_logic.py`)
-   **Smarter, More Dynamic AI:** The core `_choose_action_for_team` function was completely refactored.
    -   **Pre-condition Checks:** Before choosing an action, the AI now evaluates the current game state to determine which actions are actually possible. For example, it will not attempt to attack if there are no enemy lines, or try to shield a line if all lines are already shielded.
    -   **Reduced Failed Actions:** This intelligent filtering dramatically reduces the number of "failed action" log messages, making the game log cleaner and the simulation feel more purposeful.
    -   **Improved Weighting System:** The logic for applying trait-based preferences was updated to a more flexible base-weight and multiplier system, which is applied *only* to the list of possible actions.
-   **Robust Turn Execution:** The main `run_next_turn` loop was updated to gracefully handle cases where a team has no possible actions to perform, preventing errors and logging an appropriate message.
