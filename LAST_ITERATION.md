*   **Improved Documentation:** Updated the descriptions of several actions (`fight_hull_breach`, `fight_pincer_attack`, `fortify_mirror_structure`) in `action_data.py` to more accurately reflect their in-game fallback behaviors and implementation logic.
*   **Security Hardening:** Added a check to the `/game_app/` file-serving route in `routes.py` to ensure it is only active in debug/development mode, preventing potential exposure of source files in a non-debug environment.
*   **Code Review:** Performed a general code review for consistency with `design.md`. Confirmed that the "no cost" action implementation (granting a bonus action) aligns with the design document's intent.
