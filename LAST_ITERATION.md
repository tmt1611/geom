This iteration focuses on adding a new strategic element—the Parallelogram Rune—and improving the robustness of existing actions by ensuring they always have a useful outcome, aligning with the "never useless" design principle.

### 1. New Rune: The Parallelogram-Rune
- **New Geometric Formation:** A "Parallelogram-Rune" has been introduced. It is formed by four of a team's points creating a non-rectangular parallelogram, with all four side-lines connected. This adds a new tactical shape for players to construct.
- **New Geometric Helper:** A new helper function, `is_parallelogram`, was added to robustly detect this shape.
- **New Action (`Parallel Discharge`):** This rune unlocks a powerful area-denial action. When activated, it destroys all enemy lines that cross through the interior of the parallelogram.
- **"Never Useless" Fallback:** If the `Parallel Discharge` hits no enemy lines, the action creates a new central structure inside the rune—two new points at the midpoints of the diagonals, connected by a new line. This fallback reinforces the team's board presence instead of wasting a turn.

### 2. Improved Action Reliability
- **`Form Bastion` Fallback:** The `Form Bastion` action is now more reliable. If a team attempts this action but has no valid formation, it no longer fails. Instead, it identifies the team's most-connected fortified point and reinforces all of its connected lines, strengthening a key defensive position as a useful fallback.

### 3. Code Cleanup and Refactoring
- **Refactored `_check_cross_rune`:** The logic for detecting Cross-Runes was rewritten to be more robust and efficient. It now correctly identifies the diagonals of a valid rectangle and checks for their existence, preventing potential geometric edge cases.
- **Removed Redundancy:** The unused and redundant `init_game_state()` function was removed from `game_logic.py`, simplifying the codebase.

### 4. Documentation
- The `rules.md` file has been updated to include the new Parallelogram-Rune and its associated action, as well as the new fallback behavior for the `Form Bastion` action, ensuring the documentation remains synchronized with the game's mechanics.
