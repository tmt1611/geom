This iteration focused on improving the UI/UX of the "Action Guide" tab, making it more organized, readable, and compact.

### Action Guide Layout Improvements

1.  **Sectioned Layout**: The guide is now organized by action category (Expand, Fight, Fortify, etc.). Each category has its own header and grid, replacing the previous single, large grid of actions. This structured approach makes the guide much easier to navigate.
2.  **Redesigned Action Cards**: The layout of individual action cards has been changed from a horizontal to a vertical format. The illustration is now displayed prominently at the top, and the text content below can vary in height without being cut off. This makes the cards more visually appealing and space-efficient.
3.  **Code Refactoring**: The JavaScript and CSS for the Action Guide have been refactored to implement the new sectioned layout and card design. The filtering logic has been updated to work with the new structure, allowing users to filter by category and search term seamlessly.
