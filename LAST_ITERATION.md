# Iteration Analysis and Changelog

## 1. Analysis Summary
The previous iteration focused on improving the game's setup phase and final analysis readability. The UI/UX was solid, but the "divination" aspect, a core goal of the project, could be more visually engaging. The final screen presented stats, but didn't visually connect them back to the grid. Additionally, the live in-game statistics were minimal, only showing point and line counts, which missed an opportunity to show the evolving state of territorial control.

This iteration aims to directly address these points by making the final analysis more graphical and the live stats more meaningful.

## 2. Implemented Features and Improvements

### Gameplay & Backend (`game_logic.py`)
-   **Enhanced Live Stats:** The backend now calculates key metrics (point count, line count, and total controlled territory area) for each team on every state request. This data is passed to the frontend as a `live_stats` object, allowing for a more dynamic and informative view of the game as it progresses.
-   **Enriched Final Interpretation Data:** The final analysis calculation now includes the specific list of points that form each team's convex hull. This data is crucial for the new frontend visualization feature.
-   **Improved Data Consistency:** The team object sent from the backend now includes its own `id` as a property, simplifying frontend logic that needs to iterate over teams.

### Frontend UI/UX (`main.js`, `style.css`, `index.html`)
-   **New Feature - Convex Hull Visualization:** A new "Show Convex Hulls" checkbox appears on the final analysis panel when a game is complete. When toggled, it draws a dashed outline of each team's area of influence (their convex hull) directly on the canvas, using the team's color. This provides an immediate, powerful visual aid for the "divination" and analysis phase.
-   **Improved Live Stats Panel:** The "Live Stats" section in the UI has been upgraded. It now displays not only points and lines, but also the "Territory Area" for each team, updating every turn. This gives a much better sense of which teams are successfully fortifying their positions during the game.
-   **Code Cleanup:** Fixed a minor bug in `main.js` involving a duplicate variable declaration. Refactored UI update logic to be cleaner and use the new data structures provided by the backend.
