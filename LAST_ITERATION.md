This iteration focuses on cleaning up the codebase by removing dead and duplicated code, fixing a UI display bug, and improving maintainability by decoupling data from logic.

1.  **JavaScript Code Deduplication**: A large block of code containing illustration drawing functions (`illustrationHelpers` and `illustrationDrawers`) was duplicated in `static/js/main.js`. Since these are already defined in `static/js/illustrations.js` and loaded first, the redundant code has been removed from `main.js`. This fixes a bug where illustrations in the action guide might not render correctly and significantly cleans up the main JavaScript file.

2.  **JavaScript Bugfix & Cleanup**:
    *   The `updateInterpretationPanel` function in `main.js` was referencing obsolete `sentries` and `conduits` properties from the game state, which no longer exist. This has been corrected to display the count for `I-Rune`, which is the current data structure.
    *   An unused drawing function, `drawConduits`, which also referenced the obsolete `conduits` state, has been removed entirely.

3.  **Python Code Cleanup**:
    *   The function `get_action_groups` in `game_app/game_data.py` was defined but never called. It has been removed.
    *   In `game_app/game_logic.py`, the initial state for `runes` contained a hardcoded comment listing all possible rune types. This has been replaced with a more generic comment, decoupling the game's core logic from the specific list of runes defined in `structure_data.py`. This makes adding new rune types easier in the future.

These changes improve code health, fix a minor UI bug, and make the application more robust and easier to maintain.
