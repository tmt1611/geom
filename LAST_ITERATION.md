- **Illustration Review (SACRIFICE actions):** Reviewed all `SACRIFICE` actions for visual consistency and accuracy.
- **Code Optimization & Consistency:**
    - Created a new `drawSacrificeSymbol` helper function in `illustration_generator.js` to standardize the visual representation of a sacrificed element (a red 'X').
    - Refactored all sacrifice-related illustration functions (`sacrifice_chain_lightning`, `sacrifice_convert_point`, `sacrifice_bastion_pulse`, `sacrifice_line_retaliation`, etc.) to use this new helper. This improves code maintainability and ensures a consistent visual language.
- **Visual Design Streamlining & Consistency:**
    - **Improved `Sacrifice: Create Whirlpool` Illustration:** Replaced the misleading `drawExplosion` effect with the new `drawSacrificeSymbol`. The illustration now correctly suggests an implosion/vortex, matching the `point_implosion` visual effect in the live game.
    - **Improved `Sacrifice: Create Rift Trap` Illustration:** Replaced an incorrectly placed `drawExplosion` with `drawSacrificeSymbol`. The illustration now shows the point being sacrificed and the resulting trap symbol separately, which is clearer and more aligned with the `point_implosion` visual effect.
    - **Improved `Sacrifice: Nova Burst` Illustration:** Enhanced the illustration to include the `drawSacrificeSymbol` over the explosion, making it clearer that the explosion is the result of a point sacrifice.
- **Consistency Check:** The illustrations for all `SACRIFICE` actions now consistently use a red 'X' to denote the sacrificed element(s), improving clarity and player understanding. The illustrations for `Create Whirlpool` and `Create Rift Trap` are now more accurate representations of their in-game visual effects.
