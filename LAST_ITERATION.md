This iteration focused on improving the user interface and experience of the "Action Guide" tab, making it more compact, readable, and visually comprehensive.

### 1. Action Guide Layout Redesign

-   **Problem:** The original Action Guide used a grid of large cards. This layout was not space-efficient, requiring users to scroll extensively to view all available actions, which could feel cluttered.
-   **Solution:** The layout was redesigned from a grid to a compact list view.
    -   **CSS Changes:** The CSS for the action guide was overhauled. Instead of a grid, a flexbox column layout is now used. Each action card is now a horizontal flexbox row, with a fixed-size illustration on the left and the textual information (title, group, description) on the right. This change allows more actions to be displayed on the screen at once, reducing clutter and improving scannability.
    -   **HTML Structure Update:** The JavaScript function that dynamically generates the action cards was updated to produce a new HTML structure that is compatible with the new CSS, separating the canvas and the text content into distinct flex items.

### 2. New Illustration for "Bastion Pulse"

-   **Problem:** Several actions in the guide were missing a visual illustration, showing only a "No Illustration" placeholder.
-   **Solution:** A new illustration was created for the "Bastion Pulse" action.
    -   This new drawing function visually demonstrates the action by showing a friendly Bastion structure, one of its outer points being sacrificed, an enemy line crossing its perimeter, and an explosion effect where the pulse destroys the line.
    -   This helps users to more quickly and intuitively understand the mechanics of this complex action.

### 3. Minor Visual Fixes

-   **Problem:** During the implementation of the new illustration, it was noticed that the "ðŸ’¥" explosion emoji used in several other illustrations was not properly centered on the point of impact.
-   **Solution:** A minor fix was applied to all relevant illustration functions, setting `textAlign` and `textBaseline` on the canvas context before drawing the emoji. This ensures consistent and accurate visual feedback across all illustrations.
