- **Action System Redesign & Rules Reorganization:** Overhauled the action system to be based on explicit conditions. Every action now has a clear prerequisite (e.g., "Team has at least 2 points", "Team has a V-Rune") which determines its availability. The `rules.md` documentation was completely rewritten to organize all actions based on these conditions, making it much easier to understand why an action is available.
- **Action Verification & Refinement:** Reviewed all actions in the `Expand` group to ensure their Python implementations match their descriptions. Updated the description for `Convert Point` to be more precise about its preference for sacrificing non-critical lines.
- **Visualization Improvement:** Added a visual effect for the `Create Orbital` fallback (`orbital_fizzle_strengthen`) to provide better user feedback. Differentiated the visual effect for `Sentry Zap` from the standard `Attack Line` by giving it a unique "jagged ray" effect and color, making actions more visually distinct.
