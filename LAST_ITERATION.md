- **Status Bar Narration Color:** The status bar text at the bottom of the grid now uses the acting team's color for the entire message, more closely matching the design request. Team names within the message remain distinctly colored.
- **Code Refactoring:** Refactored the `updateLog` function in `main.js` to use a new `colorizeTeamNames` helper function. This removes duplicated code and improves maintainability.
- **Feature Review:** Confirmed that other requested features (explicit point randomization, action previews, log coloring, dev tools visibility, step-back controls, simulation progress bar) are already implemented and functioning as intended.
