- **Code Optimization (Performance):**
    - **Optimized Formation Finding:** The check for `Purifier` formations (regular pentagons) could be very slow with many points. It now checks a random sample of up to 500 combinations instead of all possible combinations, preventing game hangs while maintaining a good chance of finding a valid formation.
    - **Streamlined Precondition Checks:** Several `Sacrifice` actions (`Nova Burst`, `Create Whirlpool`, `Rift Trap`) used an expensive precondition check that found a specific sacrificial point, including checking for graph articulation points. These checks have been replaced with a much faster version that only verifies if a non-critical point exists, improving performance. The full, expensive check is still performed within the action logic itself, ensuring correctness.
