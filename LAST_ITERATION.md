This iteration focuses on cleaning up the codebase, improving the user interface for a smoother workflow, and expanding the strategic options with a new geometry-based attack.

### 1. Code Refactoring

-   **File**: `game_app/game_logic.py`
-   **Change**: The large `if/elif` block in `run_next_action` used for generating log messages has been refactored. A new private helper method, `_get_log_messages`, now uses a dictionary to map action types to log message generators.
-   **Benefit**: This significantly cleans up the `run_next_action` method, making it more readable and much easier to add or modify log messages for new actions in the future.

### 2. New Combat Action: Pincer Attack

-   **Files**: `game_app/game_logic.py`, `static/js/main.js`, `rules.md`
-   **Concept**: A new action, `[FIGHT] Pincer Attack`, has been introduced to reward tactical positioning of points.
-   **Mechanics**:
    -   **Formation**: If two of a team's points "flank" a single enemy point (i.e., the three points form a wide angle, close to 180Â°), they can execute a pincer attack.
    -   **Effect**: The targeted enemy point is destroyed. This attack cannot target fortified or bastion points, making it a tool for harassing an opponent's less-defended structures.
-   **Backend (`game_logic.py`):**
    -   Implemented `fight_action_pincer_attack` with vector math (dot product) to check the angle between points.
    -   Integrated the action into the `_choose_action_for_team` logic with appropriate weights, making it a preferred choice for `Aggressive` teams.
-   **Frontend (`static/js/main.js`):**
    -   Added a new visual effect for the pincer attack, where two beams converge on and destroy the target point.

### 3. UI/UX Improvements

-   **File**: `static/js/main.js`
-   **Change 1: Smoother Team Editing**: The UI for editing a team's name and color in the setup phase has been completely reworked. Instead of replacing the entire list item with input fields, the UI now toggles between the display text and in-place input fields. This provides a much smoother and less jarring user experience.
-   **Change 2: Better Clipboard Feedback**: The intrusive `alert()` popups that appeared after copying the game log or state have been replaced. Now, the button's text temporarily changes to "Copied!" or "Copied to Clipboard!", providing clear, non-blocking feedback.

### 4. Documentation

-   **File**: `rules.md`
-   **Change**: The rules have been updated to include a description of the new **[FIGHT] Pincer Attack** action.
