- **Refactoring & Centralization (Graph Logic):**
  - Centralized the logic for calculating team graph structures (adjacency lists and point degrees) into new helper methods in `game_app/formations.py`. This removes significant code duplication.
  - Refactored `game_logic.py` to create convenient wrapper methods (`_get_team_adjacency_list`, `_get_team_degrees`) that call the new centralized `FormationManager` methods.
  - Updated all action handlers (`expand`, `fortify`, `sacrifice`) and all methods within `FormationManager` to use these new helpers instead of calculating graph properties locally. This improves code reuse, maintainability, and consistency.
