This iteration focused on minor code cleanup and improving consistency.

1.  **Code Deduplication**: In `game_logic.py`, a block of code responsible for granting bonus actions from Wonders was duplicated. One of the blocks has been removed, making the `_build_action_queue` method cleaner and less redundant.

2.  **Precondition Consistency**: In `fortify_actions.py`, the precondition check for the `mirror_structure` action (`can_perform_mirror_structure`) used a different number of attempts to find a valid operation than the action's implementation. The precondition has been updated to use the same number of attempts as the action, ensuring the check is as accurate as possible and preventing cases where an action might be possible but deemed invalid by its precondition.
