# Iteration Analysis and Changelog

## 1. Analysis Summary
This iteration focused on improving the frontend user experience (UX) and interface (UI), particularly during the setup phase of the game. Based on a user workflow analysis, several small but impactful changes were identified to make game setup more intuitive and flexible.

## 2. Implemented Features and Improvements

### Frontend UI/UX (`templates/index.html`, `static/css/style.css`, `static/js/main.js`)

1.  **Live Grid Size Updates:**
    -   The grid on the canvas now updates instantly when the "Grid Size" input is changed during the setup phase.
    -   If changing the size would cause existing points to be out of bounds, a confirmation dialog now warns the user before those points are removed.

2.  **Improved Point Placement Controls:**
    -   A new **"Clear All Points"** button has been added to the setup controls, allowing users to quickly clear the board with a confirmation prompt.
    -   The **"Randomize Points"** button now checks if there are already points on the grid and asks for confirmation before replacing them. This prevents accidental loss of a manual setup.

3.  **Cleaner Interface:**
    -   The "Debug Tools" section in the analysis panel has been placed inside a collapsible `<details>` element. This declutters the main interface for regular users while keeping debug options easily accessible for developers or power users. Custom styling was added to make the collapsible section look clean and modern.

This set of changes makes the initial interaction with the application smoother and gives the user more control and better feedback during the critical setup stage.
