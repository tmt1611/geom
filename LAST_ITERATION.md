This iteration focuses on cleaning up the UI, fixing bugs in the team management interface, and improving the overall user experience during the setup phase.

### UI Cleanup and Bug Fixes for Team Management

-   **Files**: `static/js/main.js`, `templates/index.html`, `static/css/style.css`
-   **Change 1 (Bug Fix)**: Fixed a visual bug in the team editing UI where the team's name and trait would appear alongside the input fields instead of being replaced by them. The display logic in `main.js` was corrected to properly hide the static display elements and show the edit controls, creating a seamless inline-editing experience.
-   **Change 2 (UI Polish)**: The "Add Team" form in the setup panel has been redesigned. The input fields and button are now horizontally aligned in a flex container, removing awkward line breaks and inline styles. This provides a cleaner and more professional look.
-   **Change 3 (UX Improvement)**: The "Save" and "Cancel" buttons in the team edit mode have been changed from text to icons (a checkmark and a cross) to be consistent with the other action icons (edit, delete). This creates a more uniform and intuitive interface.
