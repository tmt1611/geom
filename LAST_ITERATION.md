This iteration focuses on code quality by fixing a critical bug and refactoring several methods for clarity and robustness.

### Code Cleanup and Refactoring

1.  **Bug Fix (Missing Import):** A runtime error was prevented in `game_app/actions/rune_actions.py`. The `area_shield` action depends on the `is_point_inside_triangle` helper function from the geometry module, but it was not being imported. This has now been corrected.
2.  **Code Refactoring in `game_logic.py`:**
    *   Simplified the `_get_structure_point_ids_by_type` method by using `dict.get()` with a default value (`{}`). This removes unnecessary `if` checks, making the code cleaner and more robust against missing keys in the game state.
    *   Improved readability in `_get_critical_structure_point_ids`. The logic now uses list comprehensions to pre-filter structures by team before iterating over them. This approach makes the intent of the code clearer by separating the filtering logic from the processing logic.
