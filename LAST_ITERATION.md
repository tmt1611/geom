- **Documentation Refactor:** Completely restructured the Actions section in `rules.md`. All game actions are now organized into groups (Expand, Fight, Fortify, Sacrifice, Rune, Terraform) and then sub-categorized by the specific geometric or structural condition required to perform them. This makes the rules clearer and aligns the documentation with the game's logic.
- **Action Implementation Review:** Reviewed the `Fight` action group to ensure their precondition checks (`can_perform_...` methods) are correct and align with their descriptions.
- **New Visualization:** Implemented new visual effects for the `Hull Breach` action and its fallbacks in `visuals.js`. This includes a flashing polygon for the hull, flashes for line reinforcement/creation, and a pulse effect, ensuring this action now provides clear visual feedback to the user.
