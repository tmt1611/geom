- **Refactoring & Centralization (Sacrifice Logic):**
  - Refactored the `_get_eligible_phase_shift_lines` helper in `sacrifice_actions.py`.
  - The original implementation manually calculated which points were "critical" by checking multiple structure types. This was replaced with a call to the centralized `game._get_critical_structure_point_ids` helper, which uses the structure registry in `structure_data.py`.
  - The internal logic was also cleaned up to be more readable and robust, first filtering for non-critical lines and then applying a preference for safer lines within that subset.
  - This improves maintainability by removing duplicated logic and centralizing the definition of "critical structures". It affects the `phase_shift`, `convert_point`, and `line_retaliation` sacrifice actions.
