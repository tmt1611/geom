This iteration focuses on improving code quality and ensuring the robustness of the "Expand" actions, aligning with the core design principle that actions should never be useless.

### 1. Code Refactoring for "Strengthen Line" Fallback

Several "Expand" actions (`Add Line`, `Extend Line`, `Fracture Line`, `Grow Line`) shared a common fallback behavior: if the primary action was not possible, they would strengthen an existing friendly line. This logic was duplicated across four different methods.

- **Introduced Helper Functions:** Two new internal helper methods, `_strengthen_line` and `_fallback_strengthen_random_line`, were created in `game_logic.py`. These centralize the logic for strengthening a line and generating the standard fallback action result.
- **Simplified Action Methods:** The four "Expand" actions mentioned above were refactored to remove the duplicated code and now call the new `_fallback_strengthen_random_line` helper. This makes the action methods shorter, cleaner, and easier to maintain.
- **Improved Code Readability:** The `expand_action_add_line` method was also slightly optimized to use a more Pythonic list comprehension with `itertools.combinations` for finding possible new lines, improving both readability and performance.

### 2. Enhanced Action Logging and Consistency

To improve clarity in the game log, the naming convention for "fizzled" actions that result in a fallback has been standardized.

- **Consistent Naming:** The fallback type for the "Add Line" action was changed from `add_line_fallback_strengthen` to `add_line_fizzle_strengthen`, matching the pattern used by other similar actions.
- **More Descriptive Logs:** The short log message for this fallback was updated from the generic `[REINFORCE]` to the more descriptive `[ADD->REINFORCE]`, making it clearer to the player what action was attempted and what the result was.

### 3. Documentation and Rule Cleanup

- **`rules.md`:** A minor text duplication in the description for the "Create Whirlpool" action was identified and corrected, improving the clarity of the rules documentation.
- **`game_logic.py`:** Corrected a misleading docstring for the `expand_action_grow_line` method to accurately reflect that its fallback strengthens a *random* line, not necessarily the source line.

Overall, these changes contribute to a cleaner, more maintainable codebase and a more consistent and understandable experience for the player, reinforcing the "never useless action" design philosophy.
