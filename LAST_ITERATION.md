*   **Refactor (JS):** Removed the redundant `illustrationHelpers` and `illustrationDrawers` objects from `main.js`. This functionality is already provided by the globally-loaded `illustrations.js` file, which defines these objects. This change removes a large block of duplicated code (approximately 700 lines) from `main.js`, significantly reducing its size and improving readability and maintainability.
