*   **Refactor (Action System):** Introduced a new `Terraform` action group and handler.
*   **Refactor (Code Organization):** Moved the `form_rift_spire` and `create_fissure` actions from the `Fortify` handler to the new `TerraformActionsHandler` for better logical separation. This included creating a new file `game_app/actions/terraform_actions.py`.
*   **Update:** Adjusted action registry, group weights, and core game logic to integrate the new `Terraform` action group.
