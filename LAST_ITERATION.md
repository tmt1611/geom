- **Game Log Readability:** The game log entries for team actions now have a background matching the team's color. To ensure readability, the text color will automatically switch between dark gray and white for the best contrast. Environment events (like point regeneration) will keep a neutral background but will have a colored border indicating the associated team, making the log clearer to follow.
- **Status Bar Narration:** The narration text at the bottom of the grid is now colored according to the acting team. To make the team names stand out against this colored text, the acting team's name is rendered in white, while any other mentioned team's name appears in its own color. This improves readability, especially when a team's name appears in its own narration.
