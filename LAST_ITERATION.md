This iteration focused on cleaning up "no-cost" actions to ensure they adhere strictly to the design principle that they should not have an implicit cost.

1.  **Refactored "No-Cost" Actions**:
    *   The `Reposition Point` and `Rotate Point` actions were designed to be free tactical moves. However, their implementation caused them to fall back to `Strengthen Line` if they failed, which *does* have a cost (1 point). This violated the "no cost" rule.
    *   The actions and their preconditions in `game_app/actions/fortify_actions.py` have been refactored.
    *   Now, they are only offered if a valid "free" point exists to be moved.
    *   If the action is chosen but a valid new position cannot be found (e.g., all nearby spots are blocked), the action now "fizzles" instead of falling back to a costly alternative.
    *   This fizzle consumes the team's turn but has no point cost, making the action a true no-cost, low-risk tactical choice.

2.  **Updated Action Metadata**:
    *   The descriptions and log generators for these actions in `game_app/action_data.py` were updated to reflect the new fizzle-based logic, removing any mention of strengthening lines. This provides clearer and more accurate feedback to the user.
