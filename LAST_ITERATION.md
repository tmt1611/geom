# Iteration Analysis and Changelog

## 1. Analysis Summary
This iteration focused on expanding the strategic depth and visual variety of the game by introducing a new high-tier geometric structure: the **Bastion**. This addition provides teams with a new powerful defensive option that requires a multi-step construction process, rewarding long-term planning and creating new visual elements on the battlefield.

## 2. Key Changes

### 2.1. New Structure: The Bastion
- **Files**: `game_app/game_logic.py`, `static/js/main.js`, `rules.md`
- **Concept**: A bastion is a powerful defensive fortification built around a claimed territory vertex.
- **Formation**:
    - A new action, **`[FORTIFY] Form Bastion`**, was created.
    - A team must first have a claimed triangular territory.
    - The action converts one of the territory's corner points (now a "core") and at least three connected "prong" points into a bastion.
- **Benefits**:
    - **Immunity**: The bastion's core, prongs, and connecting lines become immune to standard attacks and conversion, making them very durable.
    - **New Action**: Unlocks the **`[FIGHT] Bastion Pulse`** action. This action sacrifices a prong point to unleash a shockwave, destroying all enemy lines that cross the bastion's perimeter.

### 2.2. Backend Logic Implementation
- **File**: `game_app/game_logic.py`
- **State Management**: Added a `bastions` dictionary to the game state to track active bastions.
- **Action Logic**: Implemented the `fortify_action_form_bastion` and `fight_action_bastion_pulse` functions.
- **Immunity System**: Actions like `attack_line` and `convert_point` were updated to respect the new immunity granted by bastions.
- **AI Behavior**: The `_choose_action_for_team` logic was updated to include the new actions, with weights favoring `Defensive` traits for building bastions and `Aggressive` traits for using their pulse ability.

### 2.3. Frontend Visualization
- **File**: `static/js/main.js`
- **Point Rendering**: The `drawPoints` function was updated to render bastion components with distinct shapes (large outlined squares for cores, smaller squares for prongs).
- **Line Rendering**: Bastion connecting lines are now drawn thicker to signify their importance.
- **Action Highlighting**: Visual feedback was added to highlight newly formed bastions and the area of effect for a bastion pulse.

### 2.4. Documentation
- **File**: `rules.md`
- The rules were updated to explain the formation, benefits, and new actions associated with the Bastion structure.

## 3. Benefits of Changes
- **Increased Strategic Depth**: Players (or the AI teams) now have a new strategic path to pursue, focusing on defense and area control. This creates a counter-play dynamic between bastion-builders and teams with powerful rune attacks (like the V-Rune's bisector shot, which can still damage bastion lines).
- **Enhanced Visual Interest**: The new bastion structures and their unique rendering create more complex and visually distinct patterns on the grid, contributing to the "visually stunning auto-battle" goal.
- **Rewards Geometric Construction**: The multi-step requirement for creating a bastion (claim territory -> build outward -> form bastion) directly rewards players for creating specific geometric patterns over just expanding randomly.
