- **Illustration Review (FORTIFY actions):** Reviewed all `FORTIFY` actions for visual consistency and clarity.
- **Visual Effect Improvements:**
    - **`Reposition Point`:** Added a new `reposition_trail` visual effect (a fading dashed line) to make this no-cost action more visually informative, matching its illustration's intent.
    - **`Rotate Point`:** Added a new `rotation_arc` visual effect to draw the path of rotation, bringing the in-game effect in line with its excellent illustration.
    - **`Mirror Structure`:** Enhanced the visual effect to show the new points and lines forming, making the action more dynamic and impactful.
- **Visual Design Streamlining & Consistency:**
    - **`Create Anchor` Illustration:** Updated the illustration to include a pulsing ring, aligning it with its in-game rendered effect and ensuring the guide and game visuals are identical.
- **Consistency Check:** Confirmed that other `FORTIFY` actions (`Claim Territory`, `Form Bastion`, `Form Monolith`, `Shield Line`, etc.) already have a consistent visual language across their illustrations, effects, and final rendered states.
