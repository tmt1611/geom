- **Implemented Async Simulation with Progress Bar:** Added a new `api.startGameAsync` method to run the simulation asynchronously when using the in-browser Pyodide engine. This prevents the UI from freezing on long simulations and enables a real-time progress bar to show turn-by-turn advancement, addressing the request for a progress visual.
- **Improved Status Bar Narration:** The status bar text at the bottom of the grid is now colored according to the team that performed the last action. To ensure readability with light team colors, a text shadow has been added to both the main text and the team names within it.
- **Feature Review:** Confirmed that other requested features (explicit point randomization, action previews, log coloring, dev tools visibility, step-back controls) are already implemented and functioning as intended.
