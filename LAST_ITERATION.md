- **Fix (JS):** Implemented rendering logic in `renderer.js` for over a dozen visual effects (e.g., `nova_burst`, `growing_wall`, `energy_spiral`) that were being created by `visuals.js` but were not being drawn. This fixes a major visual bug from a previous refactor and makes the game significantly more engaging.
- **Fix (JS):** Corrected a minor bug in the `chain_lightning` visual effect where it would always originate from a fixed endpoint of an I-Rune instead of the endpoint closest to the target.
- **Consistency (Docs):** Refactored `rules.md` to improve clarity and consistency with the actual game mechanics. Moved passive structure formations (Prism, Nexus) to their own section, corrected action categories (e.g., `Attune Nexus` is now correctly listed as a Sacrifice action), and fixed an inaccurate description of the Monolith's bonus.
- **Best Practice (Dev):** Updated the developer live-reload configuration in `game_app/utils.py` to watch all JavaScript source files (`renderer.js`, `visuals.js`, `illustrations.js`), ensuring the "server outdated" message appears correctly when frontend logic is changed.
