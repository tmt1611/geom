This iteration focuses on cleaning the Python codebase by refactoring for better separation of concerns and simplifying complex functions.

1.  **Refactoring Geometry Functions**: The `_get_extended_border_point` and `_is_ray_blocked` methods were previously stateful methods within the main `Game` class, accessing `self.state` directly. They have been refactored into pure functions in `geometry.py` (`get_extended_border_point` and `is_ray_blocked`), which now receive necessary state information (like `grid_size`, `fissures`, `barricades`) as arguments. The original methods in `game_logic.py` have been converted into thin wrappers that call these new, pure geometry functions. This change improves code organization by moving pure geometric calculations into the `geometry` module, enhancing separation of concerns and making the code easier to test and reason about.

2.  **Simplifying Complex Action Logic**: The `attack_line` method in `fight_actions.py` was a large, multi-step function responsible for finding a target, handling a successful hit (including damage vs. destruction), and handling a miss. To improve readability and maintainability, this logic has been broken down into three smaller, more focused private helper methods: `_find_closest_attack_hit`, `_handle_attack_hit`, and `_handle_attack_miss`. The main `attack_line` method now serves as a coordinator, orchestrating calls to these helpers, which makes its logic significantly clearer and more manageable.
