- **UI (Previous Step):** Added a "Prev Step" button to the game controls, allowing users to step backward through the simulation replay (`index.html`, `static/js/main.js`).
- **UI (Progress Bar):** Implemented a progress bar in the game controls that visually indicates the current step in the simulation history (`index.html`, `static/css/style.css`, `static/js/main.js`).
- **UI (Action Preview):** Reworked the "Next Step Preview" panel to show the calculated action probabilities for the upcoming team's turn. This provides insight into the AI's potential moves at each step of the simulation (`game_app/game_logic.py`, `static/js/main.js`).
- **UI (Log Clarity):** Changed start-of-turn "environment" events in the game log (e.g., point regeneration, structure decay) to have a neutral background instead of a team-specific color, improving the visual distinction between passive effects and direct team actions (`game_app/turn_processor.py`).
