# Iteration Analysis and Changelog

## 1. Analysis Summary
This iteration focuses on increasing the strategic value of existing actions and adding a new, visually impressive action to make the battlefield more dynamic. The goal is to reward players for establishing strongholds and to add more variety to expansive strategies.

## 2. Implemented Features and Improvements

### "Fortified Territory" Mechanic (`game_logic.py`, `static/js/main.js`)
The `Fortify Territory` action has been enhanced to provide significant defensive bonuses, making it a more crucial part of a defensive or "turtling" strategy.

1.  **New Mechanic:** When a team claims a triangle as territory:
    *   The three corner points become **Fortified**. Fortified points are immune to the `Convert Point` action, protecting them from being stolen by rivals.
    - The three boundary lines become **Reinforced**. They cannot be fractured by their owner, which helps preserve the integrity of the claimed territory.
2.  **Visual Cue:** Fortified points are now rendered as diamond shapes on the canvas, providing a clear visual distinction from regular points.

### New Action: "Create Orbital" (`game_logic.py`, `static/js/main.js`, `rules.md`)
A new high-tier expansion action has been added to create more interesting geometric patterns.

1.  **[EXPAND] Create Orbital:**
    -   **Description:** A team with at least 5 points can perform this action. It selects one of its points as a center and creates a constellation of 3-5 new "satellite" points in a circular orbit around it, automatically connecting them to the center with new lines.
    -   **Behavior:** This action is weighted to be preferred by the `Expansive` trait and provides a powerful way to quickly increase point and line count, creating visually distinct star-like structures.
    -   **Visualization:** The new action is highlighted on the frontend when it occurs, and a new log message describes the event.

### Minor Improvements
-   The `Convert Point` action will now fail with a more descriptive reason (`no vulnerable enemy points in range`) if all potential targets are fortified.
-   The `Fracture Line` action will now fail with a more descriptive reason if the only available lines are part of a reinforced territory boundary.
