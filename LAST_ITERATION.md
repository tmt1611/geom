- **Illustration Review (FORTIFY actions):** Reviewed all `FORTIFY` actions for illustration coverage. All actions were found to have corresponding illustration code.
- **Visual Design Streamlining & Consistency:**
    - **Improved `Fortify: Form Bastion` Illustration:** The illustration was updated to draw bastion "prong" points as squares and the connecting lines thicker, matching the specific visuals used for Bastion structures in the live game renderer.
    - **Improved `Fortify: Form Monolith` Illustration:** The illustration was updated to draw the structure's points as tall, thin rectangles ("pillars") instead of circles, aligning it with the unique visual style of Monoliths in-game.
    - **Improved `Fortify: Form Purifier` Illustration:** The illustration's points are now drawn as star-like shapes, and the pentagonal area is filled with a transparent color. This change matches the in-game renderer for Purifier points and makes the structure more visually distinct.
    - **Improved `Fortify: Create Ley Line` Illustration:** The drawing order was adjusted to render the points on top of the glow effect, making them appear sharper and improving overall clarity.
- **Visual Effects Improvement:**
    - **Added `Create Ley Line` Effect:** A new `line_flash` visual effect was added for the `Create Ley Line` action. This provides immediate visual feedback when an I-Rune is activated into a Ley Line, which was previously a purely static state change.
- **Consistency Check:** All `FORTIFY` action illustrations and their corresponding in-game visuals are now more consistent, improving the user's ability to connect the Action Guide with live gameplay.
