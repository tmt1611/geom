- **Playback Controls:** Implemented the "Previous Step" button functionality, allowing users to step backward through the simulation replay. This involved creating a new function in `main.js` to handle backward navigation and fixing a bug where the button was incorrectly wired to the "next step" action.
- **Code Refactoring:** Improved the backend code in `game_logic.py` by refactoring the `run_full_simulation` method. The complex logic for augmenting historical game states for the frontend was extracted into a dedicated helper function, `_augment_historical_state`, making the main simulation loop cleaner and easier to understand. A duplicated function was also removed.
