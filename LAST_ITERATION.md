### 1. Game-Phase UI Redesign: Multi-Column Layout
- **Files**: `templates/index.html`, `static/css/style.css`, `static/js/main.js`
- **Change**: The UI for the game-playing phase has been redesigned from a two-column layout to a four-column layout, providing better information separation and clarity, as requested.
  - The main right-hand panel was split into three distinct, independently scrollable columns.
  - **Column 1:** The grid remains the main focus area.
  - **Column 2:** Contains high-level controls and status information (Game Controls, Dev Tools, Turn Counter, Live Stats, and the Final Analysis when the game ends).
  - **Column 3:** Is now dedicated entirely to the "Action Preview" panel, giving it more space.
  - **Column 4:** Is now dedicated entirely to the "Game Log".
- **Benefit**: This new layout is cleaner, more organized, and makes better use of wider screens. It prevents different UI sections (like the log and stats) from competing for space within a single panel.

### 2. Code Refactoring and Cleanup
- **`static/js/main.js`**: Refactored the monolithic `drawPoints` function. The specific drawing logic for each special point type (e.g., bastion, fortified, sentry) was extracted into a `pointRenderers` object. The main function now iterates through this map, making the code cleaner, more modular, and easier to extend with new point types.
- **`game_app/game_logic.py`**: Refactored the complex `_delete_point_and_connections` method. A new helper, `_cleanup_structures_for_point`, was created to handle the removal of a point from all associated secondary structures (lines, territories, bastions, etc.). This simplifies the main deletion function, improving readability and separating concerns. The new helper was also made more robust to clean up all structure types that rely on point lists.
