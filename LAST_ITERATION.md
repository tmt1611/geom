- **Refactoring (Python):** Decoupled action handlers by moving the `_find_closest_attack_hit` helper method from `FightActionsHandler` into the main `Game` class. It was renamed to `_find_first_ray_hit` and given a more generic signature to better reflect its role as a shared utility. This improves modularity and removes the need for `SacrificeActionsHandler` to call a method on `FightActionsHandler`. (See `game_logic.py`, `actions/fight_actions.py`, `actions/sacrifice_actions.py`).
- **Optimization (Python):** Simplified the `sentry_zap` action in `actions/fight_actions.py`. It now uses the centralized `_get_vulnerable_enemy_points` helper from `game_logic.py` instead of its own redundant logic for filtering out stasis points, improving both performance and code consistency.
- **Consistency (Python):** Standardized the wording for "no cost" actions in `action_data.py`. The description for the `rune_t_hammer_slam` action was changed from "...costs no points" to "...has no cost" to match the phrasing used for all other `no_cost` actions in the game.
