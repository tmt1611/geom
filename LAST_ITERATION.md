# Iteration Analysis and Changelog

## 1. Analysis Summary
The previous iteration was successful in making the UI more flexible with a responsive canvas and editable teams during setup. The codebase, however, contained a significant bug: a duplicated function definition (`expand_action_grow_line`) in `game_logic.py`. The gameplay, while varied, could benefit from more strategic, area-of-effect actions that alter the board's dynamics over several turns. This iteration focuses on fixing the critical bug, introducing such a strategic action, and adding minor quality-of-life improvements.

## 2. Implemented Features and Improvements

### Gameplay & Backend (`game_logic.py`)
-   **CRITICAL FIX:** Removed the duplicated `expand_action_grow_line` method, resolving a code consistency issue.
-   **New Action - Create Anchor:** A new `FORTIFY` action has been introduced.
    -   A team sacrifices one point to turn another of its points into a gravitational "Anchor" for a limited time.
    -   Each turn, the Anchor pulls nearby enemy points towards it, shifting their positions on the grid. This introduces a new strategic layer of area control and battlefield manipulation, leading to dynamic and unpredictable point clustering.
-   **Anchor State Management:**
    -   Added `anchors` to the game state to track active anchors and their remaining duration.
    -   The main turn loop (`run_next_turn`) now includes a maintenance phase to process anchor effects and expire old ones. Point coordinates are now `float` values to allow for smooth movement.
-   **Enhanced AI:** The new "Create Anchor" action has been integrated into the team AI (`_choose_action_for_team`), with a higher weight for the 'Defensive' trait.

### Frontend & UI (`main.js`, `style.css`, `templates/index.html`)
-   **Anchor Visualization (`main.js`):** Anchor points are now visually distinct. They are rendered as squares with a pulsing halo to indicate their active gravitational effect, providing clear visual feedback to the user.
-   **Higher Playback Speed (`templates/index.html`):** The minimum delay for auto-play has been lowered from 50ms to 10ms, allowing users to run simulations at a much faster pace.

### Documentation (`rules.md`)
-   The game rules have been updated to include a description of the new "Create Anchor" action and its effects.
