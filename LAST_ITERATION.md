- **Refactoring & Optimization (Action Efficiency):**
  - Optimized the precondition checks for `add_line` and `parallel_strike` to remove inefficient loops and rely on faster, direct calculations. This improves performance during the action selection phase of a turn.
  - Refactored the `parallel_strike` action implementation to avoid pre-calculating and storing a potentially large list of all valid action combinations. It now finds a valid combination on-the-fly, making it significantly more performant.
