- **Optimization (Python):** Removed computationally expensive articulation point checks from the precondition checks and action logic of several non-destructive actions (`create_anchor`, `reposition_point`, `rotate_point`). This significantly improves performance during action selection, especially for teams with large, complex structures, without compromising core game mechanics. The check for "critical structure points" was deemed sufficient to prevent these actions from breaking important formations. (See `game_app/actions/fortify_actions.py` and `game_app/game_logic.py`).
- **Robustness (Python):** Added fallback logic to the `form_purifier` action in `game_app/actions/fortify_actions.py`. Previously, this action could fail if no valid pentagon formation was found, even if its loose precondition (`>= 5 points`) was met. It now has a fallback that reinforces the lines of a potential structure, making the action more reliable and consistent with the design principle of actions having fallbacks.
- **Consistency (Python):** Updated `game_app/action_data.py` to include a new log generator and a more accurate description for the `form_purifier` action to reflect its new fallback capability.
