# Iteration Analysis and Changelog

## 1. Analysis Summary
The application has a solid foundation with multiple actions, a working UI, and a final interpretation panel. The key opportunities for improvement were to:
1.  Make the backend data structures more robust to support more complex actions like point removal.
2.  Increase the visual dynamism and feedback to better meet the "visually impressive" goal.
3.  Enhance the user experience during the setup phase with more flexible controls.
4.  Deepen the "divination" aspect by providing qualitative interpretations instead of just raw numbers.

This iteration focused on addressing these four areas through a significant refactoring and the addition of several new features.

## 2. Implemented Features and Improvements

### Backend & Core Logic
-   **Major Refactoring (Point IDs):** The core data structure for points was changed from a list to a dictionary, with each point having a unique, persistent ID. Lines and territories now reference these stable IDs instead of fragile list indices. This is a crucial improvement for code robustness and enables more complex actions.
-   **New Action - "Nova Burst":** A new `sacrifice_action_nova_burst` was added to `game_logic.py`. A team can sacrifice one of its own points, which then destroys all nearby enemy lines in a radius. This adds a dramatic, high-risk/high-reward strategic element and a visually exciting event.
-   **Enhanced "Divination":** The interpretation logic in `calculate_interpretation` now includes a `_generate_divination_text` helper. It analyzes a team's final statistics (like area efficiency, line density) to generate a short, horoscope-style sentence, fulfilling a key aspect of the original design.
-   **Action-Detail Tracking:** The game state now includes a `last_action_details` field. The backend populates this with specifics of the last action (e.g., which line was added, where a nova burst occurred), allowing the frontend to create targeted visual feedback.

### Frontend and UI/UX Improvements
-   **Enhanced Setup Controls (`index.html`, `main.js`):**
    -   An **"Undo Last Point"** button was added, allowing users to easily correct mistakes during the point placement phase.
    -   A **"Randomize Points"** button was added to quickly populate the grid with points for all created teams, facilitating faster game starts.
    -   Users can now **set the Grid Size** via a number input in the setup panel.
-   **Dynamic Visual Feedback (`main.js`):**
    -   The frontend now uses `requestAnimationFrame` for a smooth animation loop.
    -   **Nova Burst Animation:** When the "Nova Burst" action occurs, a pulsing, fading circle is rendered on the canvas at the location of the sacrificed point.
    -   **New Line Highlight:** Newly created lines are briefly highlighted with a white flash, making it much easier to see the result of the "Add Line" action.
-   **Improved Interpretation Display (`main.js`):** The final analysis table has been updated to display the new "divination text" for each team, providing a more flavorful and thematic summary of the game's outcome.
-   **Debug Support:** The "Show Point IDs" toggle now correctly displays the new unique point IDs instead of list indices.
