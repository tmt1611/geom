- **Refactoring & Robustness (Sacrifice Logic):**
    - Refactored the core logic for selecting a sacrificial point (`_find_non_critical_sacrificial_point`).
    - The adjacency list for a team's graph is now computed once by a helper and reused for finding both articulation points and node degrees, improving efficiency slightly.
    - Improved the selection criteria to not just prefer "leaf" nodes, but to sort all non-critical points by their number of connections and randomly choose one of the safest options.
    - Added a fallback for sacrifice actions: if all non-critical points are technically articulation points (e.g., in a simple cycle), one can still be sacrificed. This aligns with the design rule that the action pool should never be empty and prevents the game from getting stuck.
