- **Illustration Review (SACRIFICE Actions):** Added new illustrations for `Line Retaliation`, `Scorch Territory`, and `Attune Nexus`, which were previously missing. This completes the illustration coverage for all `SACRIFICE` actions listed in `rules.md`.
- **Illustration Design:** The new illustrations were designed to visually represent the core mechanics of each action:
    - `Line Retaliation`: Shows a point on a line being sacrificed to launch two perpendicular projectiles.
    - `Scorch Territory`: Depicts a friendly territory's points being sacrificed, leaving behind a blackened, impassable area.
    - `Attune Nexus`: Illustrates a diagonal line of a Nexus being sacrificed to create a glowing, "attuned" core.
- **Checked action coverage:** Confirmed that all `SACRIFICE` actions now have corresponding illustration code in `illustration_generator.js`.
