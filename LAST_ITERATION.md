- **Illustration Review (SACRIFICE actions):** Reviewed all `SACRIFICE` actions for visual consistency and to ensure they all had illustrations.
- **Visual Design & Effect Consistency:**
    - **`Fight: Hull Breach` & `Sacrifice: Convert Point`:** Updated illustrations to use a particle spiral effect, matching their `energy_spiral` in-game visual effect. This creates a consistent visual language for "point conversion".
    - **`Sacrifice: Create Whirlpool`:** Simplified the illustration to use curved "pull" lines, which clearly communicates the action's intent without needing a complex new helper function.
    - **`Sacrifice: Phase Shift`:** Updated illustration to include portal rings at the start and end points, aligning it with the `portal_link` in-game visual effect.
    - **`Sacrifice: Attune Nexus`:** Redesigned the illustration to show pull arrows from the sacrificed line's points into the nexus center, matching the `point_pull` visual effect.
    - **`Sacrifice: Bastion Pulse`:** Enhanced the illustration to include a "flash" fill over the bastion structure, matching its `polygon_flash` in-game effect.
- **Consistency Check:** Confirmed that other `SACRIFICE` actions (`Nova Burst`, `Line Retaliation`, `Chain Lightning`, etc.) already have a consistent visual language (e.g., use of sacrifice symbol, explosion effects) across their illustrations and in-game effects.
