- **Action System Redesign:** Overhauled the action system to be based on explicit conditions. Every action now has a clear prerequisite (e.g., "Team has at least 2 points", "Team has a V-Rune") which determines its availability in the action pool.
- **Rules Documentation Overhaul (`rules.md`):** Completely re-organized `rules.md` to align with the new condition-based action system. Actions are now grouped by their specific geometric or structural requirements, making it much easier for a user to understand why an action is available. Actions unlocked by Runes are now listed both under the Rune's description and in a unified "Rune & Structure Actions" section for clarity.
- **Action Verification (Fight/Expand):** Reviewed all actions in the `Expand` and `Fight` groups. Confirmed their Python implementations match their descriptions. Added a missing visual effect for the `Isolate Point` fallback action to ensure it provides correct feedback.
- **Action Description Update:** Updated the description for `Convert Point` to be more precise about its preference for sacrificing non-critical lines.
