        - `Rune: Cardinal Pulse`: Now shows four `attack_ray` effects firing from the rune's center, matching the action description.
        - `Rune: T-Hammer Slam`: Now shows a `line_flash` along the rune's stem to visualize the "slam" shockwave.
        - `Rune: Parallel Discharge`: Now shows a `polygon_flash` over the rune's area to represent the discharge effect.
        - `Rune: Focus Beam`: Now fires a powerful `jagged_ray` from the star's center and creates a `point_explosion` on the target, making it feel impactful.
        - `Rune: Starlight Cascade`: Added a new `starlight_cascade` effect, a radial blast of light with sparkling particles, to represent the AoE damage.
        - `Rune: Gravity Well`: Now uses the standard `shield_pulse` effect to represent the AoE push, ensuring visual consistency for identical effects.
