This iteration focuses on a significant internal refactoring to improve code quality and maintainability, specifically around how game structures are managed. The goal was to reduce repeated code and make it easier for developers to add new structures in the future.

### 1. Centralized Structure Registry

The core of this refactoring was the introduction of a new data file, `game_app/structure_data.py`. This file acts as a central registry for all complex game objects (like Bastions, Monoliths, Territories, etc.).

*   **Concept:** Instead of having various parts of the code manually list and handle each structure type, the new `STRUCTURE_DEFINITIONS` dictionary describes the properties of each structure, such as:
    *   How it's stored in the game state (`storage_type`).
    *   Which data keys contain point IDs (`point_id_keys`).
    *   Whether its points should be considered "critical" and protected from sacrifice (`is_critical`).

*   **Benefit:** This data-driven approach means that when a new, simple structure is added to the game, it only needs to be defined once in this registry. The generic logic for handling it will apply automatically, reducing boilerplate and the risk of forgetting to update a function somewhere else.

### 2. Refactored Game Logic and Turn Processing

With the new registry in place, several key parts of the codebase were simplified:

*   **`game_logic.py`:**
    *   The `_get_critical_structure_point_ids` method now reads from the registry to determine which points are part of important structures, replacing a long, hardcoded function.
    *   The `_cleanup_structures_for_point` method, which is crucial for handling what happens when a point is destroyed, was rewritten. It now uses a hybrid approach: it handles highly complex structures (like Bastions) with their existing custom logic, but uses the registry to generically and correctly dissolve any other registered structure that contained the destroyed point.
    *   The hardcoded default teams in the `reset()` method were moved into `game_data.py` for better centralization.

*   **`turn_processor.py`:**
    *   The main `process_turn_start_effects` function, which runs all start-of-turn events like shield decay and Wonder countdowns, is now driven by a `TURN_PROCESSING_ORDER` list in the new structure data file. This makes the sequence of events explicit and easy to modify.

This refactoring does not change any game rules or visuals but significantly improves the internal architecture, making the project more robust and scalable.
