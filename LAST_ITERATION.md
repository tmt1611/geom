- **UI (Status Bar):** The status bar narration at the bottom of the grid now uses team-colored text for team actions, while keeping team names distinctly colored for readability against the new background.
- **UI (Game Log):** Start-of-turn "environment" events are now consistently rendered with a neutral background, even when associated with a team. Team names within these log messages are still colorized to maintain clarity. This visually separates passive turn effects from direct team actions.
- **UI (Dev Tools):** The Developer Tools panel has been moved to a persistent location at the bottom of the main interface, making it accessible during both the game setup and simulation phases.
