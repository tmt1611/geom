- **Illustration Review (FORTIFY actions):** Reviewed all `FORTIFY` action illustrations for consistency and clarity. No illustrations were missing.
- **Illustration Design & Consistency:**
    - Updated the illustration for `Fortify: Form Bastion` to use a square for the bastion core, matching the in-game renderer (`is_bastion_core`) and improving visual consistency between the action guide and the live game. This also simplified the drawing code.
- **Visual Effects Review (FORTIFY, TERRAFORM, SACRIFICE):**
    - Reviewed visual effects for all actions in these groups to ensure they are present and visually representative.
    - **Added new effects:**
        - `Terraform: Create Fissure`: Now shows a jagged energy ray from the controlling Rift Spire, followed by a `growing_wall` effect to form the fissure.
        - `Sacrifice: Line Retaliation`: Now shows two `attack_ray` projectiles firing from the sacrificed point, matching the action's description and illustration.
        - `Sacrifice: Scorch Territory`: Now shows a fiery orange `polygon_flash` over the area before it becomes a persistent scorched zone, making the action more visually impactful.
- **Checked action coverage:** Confirmed all `FORTIFY`, `TERRAFORM`, and `SACRIFICE` actions have corresponding illustrations and have now been reviewed for visual effects.
