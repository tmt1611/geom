*   **Refactor (JS):** Removed the redundant `illustrationHelpers` and `illustrationDrawers` objects from `main.js`. This functionality is already provided by the globally-loaded `illustrations.js` file. This change reduces the line count of `main.js` by nearly 700 lines, improving its readability and maintainability.
