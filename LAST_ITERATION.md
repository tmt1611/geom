- **Refactoring (Code Correctness & Consistency):**
  - Conducted a thorough review of action handlers (`fortify_actions.py`, `sacrifice_actions.py`) to ensure consistent use of the `GameStateQuery` API that was introduced in the previous iteration.
  - Fixed multiple latent bugs in `fortify_actions.py` where methods were still calling old, non-existent functions on the main `game` object instead of the new `game.query` object. This affected actions like `mirror_structure`, `rotate_point`, `create_anchor`, and several formation-finding helpers.
  - Corrected a significant bug in the `nova_burst` sacrifice action which contained unreachable code and was not correctly selecting a point to sacrifice. The logic was streamlined to properly use the query methods.
  - These changes improve the overall stability and correctness of the game logic, ensuring that the recent refactoring is fully and properly integrated.
