*   **Fix (Bug):** Corrected a syntax error (an extra closing brace) in `action_data.py` within the `ACTIONS` dictionary.
*   **Refactor (Actions):** Updated the `line_retaliation` action to allow for point regeneration, making it consistent with other point-sacrifice actions and the design document's intent.
