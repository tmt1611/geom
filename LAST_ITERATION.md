This iteration focuses on a significant refactoring of how point properties (like being part of a structure or having a status) are calculated and sent to the frontend. The goal was to follow the DRY principle, improve maintainability, and centralize logic in a data-driven way.

**Key Changes:**

1.  **Centralized Point Flags in `structure_data.py`:**
    -   Previously, the logic for what constitutes a "fortified" point, a "bastion core", an "anchor", etc., was spread across multiple methods in `game_logic.py` (`_get_fortified_point_ids`, `_get_bastion_point_ids`, a manual dictionary `POINT_AUGMENTATIONS`).
    -   This logic has been completely centralized into the `STRUCTURE_DEFINITIONS` registry in `structure_data.py`. Each structure definition now contains `frontend_flag_key` or `frontend_flag_keys` to specify the boolean flags its points should receive (e.g., `'is_fortified'`, `'is_bastion_core'`).
    -   This makes it much easier to add new structures or change how existing ones are represented on the frontend, as all the configuration is in one place. It also fixed a minor bug where some structure flags were not being correctly applied.

2.  **Refactored Game Logic (`game_logic.py`):**
    -   Removed the now-redundant helper methods `_get_structure_point_ids_by_type` and its dependencies.
    -   Created a new, generic helper method `_get_all_point_flags()` that reads the `STRUCTURE_DEFINITIONS` registry and generates a complete map of which points have which flags (e.g., `{'is_anchor': {p1, p2}, 'is_fortified': {p3, p4}}`).
    -   Massively simplified the `_augment_points_for_frontend()` method. It now uses the output of `_get_all_point_flags()` to efficiently add all relevant boolean flags to each point object before sending the state to the client.

This refactoring makes the code cleaner, more data-driven, and easier to extend. The logic for point augmentation is now entirely derived from the central `structure_data.py` registry, reducing complexity and the chance of errors.
