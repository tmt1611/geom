- **Critical Bug Fix (Pyodide):** Corrected a major issue in `static/js/api.js` where the Pyodide (WebAssembly) backend was failing to load several action handler modules (`fight_actions.py`, `sacrifice_actions.py`, `terraform_actions.py`). This bug would have caused the application to crash in its static/GitHub Pages deployment mode when certain actions were performed.
- **Refactoring & Bug Fix (Python):** Refactored the target selection logic for the `launch_payload` action in `fight_actions.py`. The previous implementation incorrectly excluded standard fortified points from its fallback targeting. The new logic is cleaner and correctly targets high-value structures first, then any other valid enemy point as intended.
- **Consistency (Python):** The `impale` rune action is described as a devastating, piercing attack. The implementation was updated in `rune_actions.py` to remove a check that incorrectly prevented it from destroying bastion lines, making it consistent with its description.
- **Consistency (Python):** Renamed the action key `'fortify_mirror'` to `'fortify_mirror_structure'` in `action_data.py` to match its method name (`mirror_structure`). The log generator keys were also updated to match the result types returned by the Python method, fixing a logging inconsistency.
- **Documentation (Markdown):** Updated `rules.md` for the `Mirror Structure` action. The description of its fallback behavior now accurately reflects the implementation (reinforcing lines around random points) instead of describing a vague, unimplemented alternative.
