This iteration focused on improving the robustness and correctness of the action system by aligning action preconditions more closely with their implementation logic.

1.  **Strengthened Sacrifice Preconditions**: Updated the `can_perform_*` methods for several sacrifice actions (`create_whirlpool`, `rift_trap`, `phase_shift`) in `game_app/actions/sacrifice_actions.py`. Instead of naive checks (like point or line counts), the preconditions now use the same detailed helper methods (`_find_non_critical_sacrificial_point`, `_get_eligible_phase_shift_lines`) that the action implementations use. This prevents the game from attempting actions that are guaranteed to fail their internal checks.

2.  **Cleaned Up Action Implementations**: Removed now-redundant checks from the implementations of `create_whirlpool`, `rift_trap`, and `phase_shift`. Since the preconditions are now more accurate, these initial checks were unnecessary, leading to slightly cleaner and more direct code. A safeguard `if` statement was kept in place to handle edge cases, but the primary logic is now correctly handled at the precondition stage.
