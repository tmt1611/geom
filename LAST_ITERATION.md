- **Refactoring (Centralized Parameters):** Moved several "magic numbers" related to game balance (e.g., action ranges, minimum areas, action attempt limits) from various action handler modules (`fight_actions.py`, `expand_actions.py`, `game_logic.py`) into a single `GAME_PARAMETERS` dictionary in `game_data.py`. This significantly improves maintainability and makes it easier to tune game balance from one location.
- **Bug Fix (Frontend Live Stats):** Fixed a bug in the live stats display where many runes and structures were not being shown. The hardcoded list of structures was incomplete and the logic to find them was brittle. Replaced this with a robust data-driven approach using a map that correctly references all structure types from the game state, ensuring the UI accurately reflects all active formations for each team.
- **Consistency (Frontend Illustrations):** Corrected an inconsistency in the Action Guide's illustrations. The `'fortify_mirror'` key in `static/js/illustrations.js` was renamed to `'fortify_mirror_structure'` to match the actual action key in `action_data.py`, ensuring the correct illustration is displayed for the "Mirror Structure" action.
