This iteration focuses on improving the "Action Guide" tab by adding new illustrations and making the existing ones larger and clearer.

### 1. New Illustrations
To provide a more complete visual reference for players, new illustrations have been created for the following actions:
- **Fight: Refraction Beam:** The new artwork visualizes how a "Prism" structure (formed by two adjacent friendly territories) can be used to "bank" an attack shot, reflecting it around obstacles to hit a target.
- **Terraform: Create Fissure:** This illustration depicts a charged "Rift Spire" creating a jagged, impassable fissure across the game board, helping players understand this powerful terrain-altering ability.

### 2. Larger, Clearer Illustrations
The canvas size for all action illustrations in the guide has been increased from 150x100 to 180x120 pixels. This makes each visual easier to see and understand, allowing for more detail in the drawings and improving the overall presentation of the guide.
