- **Code Refactor (Python):** Simplified the `_get_possible_actions` method in `game_logic.py` by converting its logic into a more concise and Pythonic list comprehension.
- **UI Improvement (JavaScript):** Improved the readability of the status bar narration. Added a helper function to detect light team colors and automatically darken them, ensuring the text has sufficient contrast against the white background. This enhances the existing implementation of the team-colored narration.
